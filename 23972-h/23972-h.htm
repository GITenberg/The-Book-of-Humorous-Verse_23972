<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>A hope of immortality and a sense of humor distinguish man
from the beasts of the field.</p>

<p>A single exception may be made, perhaps, of the Laughing
Hyena, and, on the other hand, not every one of the human
race possesses the power of laughter. For those who do, this
volume is intended.</p>

<p>And since there can be nothing humorous about an introduction,
there can be small need of a lengthy one.</p>

<p>Merely a few explanations of conditions which may be
censured by captious critics.</p>

<p>First, the limitations of space had to be recognized.
Hence, the book is a compilation, not a collection. It is
representative, but not exhaustive. My ambition was toward
a volume to which everyone could go, with a surety of
finding any one of his favorite humorous poems between
these covers. But no covers of one book could insure that,
so I reluctantly gave up the dream for a reality which I
trust will make it possible for a majority of seekers to find
their favorites here.</p>

<p>The compiler's course is a difficult one. The Scylla of
Popularity lures him on the one hand, while the Charybdis
of the Classical charms him on the other. He has nothing
to steer by but his own good taste, and good taste, alack, is
greatly a matter of opinion.</p>

<p>And no opinion seemeth good unto an honest compiler,
save his own. Wherefore, the choice of these selections, like
kissing, went by favor. As to the arrangement of them, every
compiler will tell you that Classification is Vexation. And
why not? When many a poem may be both Parody and
Satire,&mdash;both Romance and Cynicism. Wherefore, the compiler
sorted with loving care the selections here presented
striving to do justice to the verses themselves, and
taking a chance on the tolerant good nature of the
reader.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;vi]</a></span></p>

<p>For,</p>

<p><span class='poem'>
<span class='i4'>"A jest's prosperity lies in the ear</span>
<span class='i4'>Of him that hears it.</span>
<span class='i4'>Never in the tongue</span>
<span class='i4'>Of him that makes it."</span></span>
</p>

<p>Which made me all the more careful to do my authors justice,
leaving the prosperity of the jests to the hearers.</p>

<h3>THE PLAYED-OUT HUMOURIST</h3>

<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Quixotic is his enterprise and hopeless his adventure is,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who seeks for jocularities that haven't yet been said;</span><br />
The world has joked incessantly for over fifty centuries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And every joke that's possible has long ago been made.</span><br />
I started as a humourist with lots of mental fizziness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But humour is a drug which it's the fashion to abuse;</span><br />
For my stock-in-trade, my fixtures and the good-will of the business<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No reasonable offer I am likely to refuse.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And if anybody choose</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">He may circulate the news</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That no reasonable offer I am likely to refuse.</span><br />
<br />
Oh, happy was that humourist&mdash;the first that made a pun at all&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who when a joke occurred to him, however poor and mean,</span><br />
Was absolutely certain that it never had been done at all&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How popular at dinners must that humourist have been!</span><br />
Oh, the days when some step-father for a query held a handle out,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The door-mat from the scraper, is it distant very far?</span><br />
And when no one knew where Moses was when Aaron put the candle out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And no one had discovered that a door could be a-jar!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">But your modern hearers are</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">In their tastes particular,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they sneer if you inform them that a door can be a jar!</span><br />
<br />
In search of quip and quiddity I've sat all day alone, apart&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all that I could hit on as a problem was&mdash;to find</span><br />
Analogy between a scrag of mutton and a Bony-part,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which offers slight employment to the speculative mind.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
<br />
For you cannot call it very good, however great your charity&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It's not the sort of humour that is greeted with a shout&mdash;</span><br />
And I've come to the conclusion that my mine of jocularity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In present Anno Domini is worked completely out!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Though the notion you may scout,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">I can prove beyond a doubt</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That my mine of jocularity is worked completely out!</span><br />

<h3>MARK TWAIN: A PIPE DREAM</h3>

Well I recall how first I met<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mark Twain&mdash;an infant barely three</span><br />
Rolling a tiny cigarette<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While cooing on his nurse's knee.</span><br />
<br />
Since then in every sort of place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've met with Mark and heard him joke,</span><br />
Yet how can I describe his face?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I never saw it for the smoke.</span><br />
<br />
At school he won a <i>smokership</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At Harvard College (Cambridge, Mass.)</span><br />
His name was soon on every lip,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They made him "smoker" of his class.</span><br />
<br />
Who will forget his smoking bout<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With Mount Vesuvius&mdash;our cheers&mdash;</span><br />
When Mount Vesuvius went out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And didn't smoke again for years?</span><br />
<br />
The news was flashed to England's King,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who begged Mark Twain to come and stay,</span><br />
Offered him dukedoms&mdash;anything<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To smoke the London fog away.</span><br />
<br />
But Mark was firm. "I bow," said he,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To no imperial command,</span><br />
No ducal coronet for me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My smoke is for my native land!"</span><br />

<br />
For Mark there waits a brighter crown!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Peter comes his card to read&mdash;</span><br />
He'll take the sign "No Smoking" down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Heaven will be Heaven indeed.</span><br />

<h3>FROM A FULL HEART</h3>

In days of peace my fellow-men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rightly regarded me as more like</span><br />
A Bishop than a Major-Gen.,<br />

But when this age-long struggle ends<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I have seen the Allies dish up</span><br />
The goose of Hindenburg&mdash;oh, friends!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I shall out-bish the mildest Bishop.</span><br />
<br />
<i>When the War is over and the Kaiser's out of print<br />
I'm going to buy some tortoises and watch the beggars sprint;<br />
When the War is over and the sword at last we sheathe<br />
I'm going to keep a jelly-fish and listen to it breathe.</i><br />
<br />
I never really longed for gore,<br />

That lingered with me left before<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The German troops had entered Brussels.</span><br />
In early days the Colonel's "'Shun!"<br />

The noise of some one else's gun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Left me considerably colder.</span><br />

<i>When the War is over and the battle has been won<br />

<h3>THE ULTIMATE JOY</h3>

I have felt the thrill of passion in the poet's mystic book<br />
And I've lingered in delight to catch the rhythm of the brook;<br />
I've felt the ecstasy that comes when prima donnas reach<br />
For upper C and hold it in a long, melodious screech.<br />
And yet the charm of all these blissful memories fades away<br />
As I think upon the fortune that befell the other day,<br />
As I bring to recollection, with a joyous, wistful sigh,<br />
That I woke and felt the need of extra covers in July.<br />
<br />
Oh, eerie hour of drowsiness&mdash;'twas like a fairy spell,<br />
That respite from the terrors we have known, alas, so well,<br />
The malevolent mosquito, with a limp and idle bill,<br />
Hung supinely from the ceiling, all exhausted by his chill.<br />
And the early morning sunbeam lost his customary leer<br />
And brought a gracious greeting and a prophecy of cheer;<br />
A generous affability reached up from earth to sky,<br />
When I woke and felt the need of extra covers in July.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>

<br />
In every life there comes a time of happiness supreme,<br />
When joy becomes reality and not a glittering dream.<br />
'Tis less appreciated, but it's worth a great deal more<br />
Than tides which taken at their flood lead on to fortune's shore.<br />
How vain is Art's illusion, and how potent Nature's sway<br />
When once in kindly mood she deigns to waft our woes away!<br />
And the memory will cheer me, though all other pleasures fly,<br />
Of how I woke and needed extra covers in July.<br />

But the air's so appetisin'; and the landscape through the haze<br />
Of a crisp and sunny morning of the airly autumn days<br />
Is a pictur that no painter has the colorin' to mock&mdash;<br />
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock.<br />
<br />
The husky, rusty rustle of the tossels of the corn,<br />
And the raspin' of the tangled leaves, as golden as the morn;<br />
The stubble in the furries&mdash;kindo' lonesome-like, but still<br />
A-preachin' sermons to us of the barns they growed to fill;<br />
The strawstack in the medder, and the reaper in the shed;<br />
The hosses in theyr stalls below&mdash;the clover overhead!&mdash;<br />
O, it sets my heart a-clickin' like the tickin' of a clock,<br />
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock!<br />

Melchizedek he praised the Lord,<br />

Ucalegon he lost his house<br />

<h3>A FAMILIAR LETTER TO SEVERAL CORRESPONDENTS</h3>

<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Yes, write if you want to&mdash;there's nothing like trying;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who knows what a treasure your casket may hold?</span><br />
I'll show you that rhyming's as easy as lying,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If you'll listen to me while the art I unfold.</span><br />
<br />
Here's a book full of words: one can choose as he fancies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As a painter his tint, as a workman his tool;</span><br />
Just think! all the poems and plays and romances<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were drawn out of this, like the fish from a pool!</span><br />
<br />
You can wander at will through its syllabled mazes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And take all you want&mdash;not a copper they cost;</span><br />
What is there to hinder your picking out phrases<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For an epic as clever as "Paradise Lost"?</span><br />
<br />
Don't mind if the index of sense is at zero;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Use words that run smoothly, whatever they mean;</span><br />
Leander and Lillian and Lillibullero<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are much the same thing in the rhyming machine.</span><br />
<br />
There are words so delicious their sweetness will smother<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That boarding-school flavour of which we're afraid;</span><br />
There is "lush" is a good one and "swirl" is another;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Put both in one stanza, its fortune is made.</span><br />
<br />
With musical murmurs and rhythmical closes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You can cheat us of smiles when you've nothing to tell;</span><br />
You hand us a nosegay of milliner's roses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we cry with delight, "Oh, how sweet they do smell!"</span><br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>

Perhaps you will answer all needful conditions<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For winning the laurels to which you aspire,</span><br />
By docking the tails of the two prepositions<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I' the style o' the bards you so greatly admire.</span><br />
<br />
As for subjects of verse, they are only too plenty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For ringing the changes on metrical chimes;</span><br />
A maiden, a moonbeam, a lover of twenty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have filled that great basket with bushels of rhymes.</span><br />
<br />
Let me show you a picture&mdash;'tis far from irrelevant&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By a famous old hand in the arts of design;</span><br />
'Tis only a photographed sketch of an elephant;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The name of the draughtsman was Rembrandt of Rhine.</span><br />
<br />
How easy! no troublesome colours to lay on;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It can't have fatigued him, no, not in the least;</span><br />
A dash here and there with a haphazard crayon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there stands the wrinkled-skinned, baggy-limbed beast.</span><br />
<br />
Just so with your verse&mdash;'tis as easy as sketching;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You can reel off a song without knitting your brow,</span><br />
As lightly as Rembrandt a drawing or etching;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is nothing at all, if you only know how.</span><br />
<br />
Well, imagine you've printed your volume of verses;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your forehead is wreathed with the garland of fame;</span><br />
Your poem the eloquent school-boy rehearses;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her album the school-girl presents for your name.</span><br />
<br />
Each morning the post brings you autograph letters;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You'll answer them promptly&mdash;an hour isn't much</span><br />
For the honour of sharing a page with your betters,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With magistrates, members of Congress, and such.</span><br />
<br />
Of course you're delighted to serve the committees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That come with requests from the country all round;</span><br />
You would grace the occasion with poems and ditties<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they've got a new school-house, or poor-house, or pound.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>

<br />
With a hymn for the saints, and a song for the sinners,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You go and are welcome wherever you please;</span><br />
You're a privileged guest at all manner of dinners;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You've a seat on the platform among the grandees.</span><br />
<br />
At length your mere presence becomes a sensation;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your cup of enjoyment is filled to its brim</span><br />
With the pleasure Horatian of digitmonstration,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the whisper runs round of "That's he!" or "That's him!"</span><br />
<br />
But, remember, O dealer in phrases sonorous,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So daintily chosen, so tunefully matched,</span><br />
Though you soar with the wings of the cherubim o'er us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ovum was human from which you were hatched.</span><br />
<br />
No will of your own, with its puny compulsion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can summon the spirit that quickens the lyre;</span><br />
It comes, if at all, like the sibyl's convulsion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And touches the brain with a finger of fire.</span><br />
<br />
So, perhaps, after all, it's as well to be quiet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If you've nothing you think is worth saying in prose,</span><br />
As to furnish a meal of their cannibal diet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the critics, by publishing, as you propose.</span><br />
<br />
But it's all of no use, and I'm sorry I've written;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I shall see your thin volume some day on my shelf;</span><br />
For the rhyming tarantula surely has bitten,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And music must cure you, so pipe it yourself.</span><br />

<h3>THE HEIGHT OF THE RIDICULOUS</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
I wrote some lines once on a time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In wondrous merry mood,</span><br />
And thought, as usual, men would say<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They were exceeding good.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>

<br />
They were so queer, so very queer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I laughed as I would die;</span><br />
Albeit, in the general way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A sober man am I.</span><br />
<br />
I called my servant, and he came;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How kind it was of him,</span><br />
To mind a slender man like me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He of the mighty limb!</span><br />
<br />
"These to the printer," I exclaimed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, in my humorous way,</span><br />
I added (as a trifling jest),<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"There'll be the devil to pay."</span><br />
<br />
He took the paper, and I watched,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And saw him peep within;</span><br />
At the first line he read, his face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was all upon a grin.</span><br />
<br />
He read the next, the grin grew broad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shot from ear to ear;</span><br />
He read the third, a chuckling noise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I now began to hear.</span><br />
<br />
The fourth, he broke into a roar;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fifth, his waistband split;</span><br />
The sixth, he burst five buttons off,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tumbled in a fit.</span><br />
<br />
Ten days and nights, with sleepless eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I watched that wretched man,</span><br />
And since, I never dare to write<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As funny as I can.</span><br />

<h3>SHAKE, MULLEARY AND GO-ETHE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p class='h_5'>I</p>
<p>
I have a bookcase, which is what<br />
Many much better men have not.<br />
There are no books inside, for books,<br />
I am afraid, might spoil its looks.<br />
But I've three busts, all second-hand,<br />
Upon the top. You understand<br />
I could not put them underneath&mdash;<br />
Shake, Mulleary and Go-ethe.<br />
</p>
<p class='h_5'>II</p>
<p>
Shake was a dramatist of note;<br />
He lived by writing things to quote,<br />
He long ago put on his shroud:<br />
Some of his works are rather loud.<br />
His bald-spot's dusty, I suppose.<br />
I know there's dust upon his nose.<br />
I'll have to give each nose a sheath&mdash;<br />
Shake, Mulleary and Go-ethe.<br />
</p>
<p class='h_5'>III</p>
<p>
Mulleary's line was quite the same;<br />
He has more hair, but far less fame.<br />
I would not from that fame retrench&mdash;<br />
But he is foreign, being French.<br />
Yet high his haughty head he heaves,<br />
The only one done up in leaves,<br />
They're rather limited on wreath&mdash;<br />
Shake, Mulleary and Go-ethe.<br />
</p>
<p class='h_5'>IV</p>
<p>
Go-ethe wrote in the German tongue:<br />
He must have learned it very young.<br />
His nose is quite a butt for scoff,<br />
Although an inch of it is off.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>

He did quite nicely for the Dutch;<br />
But here he doesn't count for much.<br />
They all are off their native heath&mdash;<br />
Shake, Mulleary and Go-ethe.<br />
</p>
<p class='h_5'>V</p>
<p>
They sit there, on their chests, as bland<br />
As if they were not second-hand.<br />
I do not know of what they think,<br />
Nor why they never frown or wink,<br />
But why from smiling they refrain<br />
I think I clearly can explain:<br />
They none of them could show much teeth&mdash;<br />

My dear young friend, whose shining wit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sets all the room a-blaze,</span><br />
Don't think yourself a "happy dog,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For all your merry ways;</span><br />
But learn to wear a sober phiz,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be stupid, if you can,</span><br />
It's such a very serious thing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To be a funny man!</span><br />
<br />
You're at an evening party, with<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A group of pleasant folks,&mdash;</span><br />
You venture quietly to crack<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The least of little jokes,&mdash;</span><br />
A lady doesn't catch the point,<br />

<br />
You drop a pretty <i>jeu-de-mot</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into a neighbor's ears,</span><br />
Who likes to give you credit for<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The clever thing he hears,</span><br />
And so he hawks your jest about,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The old authentic one,</span><br />
Just breaking off the point of it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And leaving out the pun!</span><br />

By sudden change in politics,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or sadder change in Polly,</span><br />
You, lose your love, or loaves, and fall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A prey to melancholy,</span><br />
While everybody marvels why<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your mirth is under ban,&mdash;</span><br />
They think your very grief "a joke,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You're such a funny man!</span><br />
<br />
You follow up a stylish card<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That bids you come and dine,</span><br />
And bring along your freshest wit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(To pay for musty wine),</span><br />
You're looking very dismal, when<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My lady bounces in,</span><br />
And wonders what you're thinking of<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And why you don't begin!</span><br />
<br />
You're telling to a knot of friends<br />

<h3>EARLY RISING</h3>

"God bless the man who first invented sleep!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So Sancho Panza said, and so say I:</span><br />
And bless him, also, that he didn't keep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His great discovery to himself; nor try</span><br />
To make it&mdash;as the lucky fellow might&mdash;<br />
A close monopoly by patent-right!<br />
<br />
Yes&mdash;bless the man who first invented sleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(I really can't avoid the iteration;)</span><br />
But blast the man, with curses loud and deep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whate'er the rascal's name, or age, or station,</span><br />
Who first invented, and went round advising,<br />
That artificial cut-off&mdash;Early Rising!<br />
<br />
"Rise with the lark, and with the lark to bed,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Observes some solemn, sentimental owl;</span><br />
Maxims like these are very cheaply said;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, ere you make yourself a fool or fowl,</span><br />
Pray just inquire about his rise and fall,<br />
And whether larks have any beds at all!<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>

<br />
The time for honest folks to be a-bed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is in the morning, if I reason right;</span><br />
And he who cannot keep his precious head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon his pillow till it's fairly light,</span><br />
And so enjoy his forty morning winks,<br />
Is up to knavery; or else&mdash;he drinks!<br />
<br />
Thompson, who sung about the "Seasons," said<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was a glorious thing to <i>rise</i> in season;</span><br />
But then he said it&mdash;lying&mdash;in his bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At ten o'clock <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,&mdash;the very reason</span><br />
He wrote so charmingly. The simple fact is<br />
His preaching wasn't sanctioned by his practice.<br />
<br />
'Tis, doubtless, well to be sometimes awake,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Awake to duty, and awake to truth,&mdash;</span><br />
But when, alas! a nice review we take<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of our best deeds and days, we find, in sooth,</span><br />
The hours that leave the slightest cause to weep<br />
Are those we passed in childhood or asleep!<br />
<br />
'Tis beautiful to leave the world awhile<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the soft visions of the gentle night;</span><br />
And free, at last, from mortal care or guile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To live as only in the angel's sight,</span><br />
In sleep's sweet realm so cosily shut in,<br />
Where, at the worst, we only <i>dream</i> of sin!<br />
<br />
So let us sleep, and give the Maker praise.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I like the lad who, when his father thought</span><br />
To clip his morning nap by hackneyed phrase<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of vagrant worm by early songster caught,</span><br />
Cried, "Served him right!&mdash;it's not at all surprising;<br />
The worm was punished, sir, for early rising!"<br />

He sat himself down at a table,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a countenance ugly as thine!"</span><br />

<h3>THE TRUTH ABOUT HORACE</h3>

It is very aggravating<br />
To hear the solemn prating<br />
Of the fossils who are stating<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That old Horace was a prude;</span><br />
When we know that with the ladies<br />
He was always raising Hades,<br />
And with many an escapade his<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Best productions are imbued.</span><br />
<br />
There's really not much harm in a<br />
Large number of his carmina,<br />
But these people find alarm in a<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Few records of his acts;</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>

<br />
So they'd squelch the muse caloric,<br />
And to students sophomoric<br />
They'd present as metaphoric<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What old Horace meant for facts.</span><br />
<br />
We have always thought 'em lazy;<br />
Now we adjudge 'em crazy!<br />
Why, Horace was a daisy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That was very much alive!</span><br />
And the wisest of us know him<br />
As his Lydia verses show him,&mdash;<br />
Go, read that virile poem,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is No. 25.</span><br />
<br />
He was a very owl, sir,<br />
And starting out to prowl, sir,<br />
You bet he made Rome howl, sir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until he filled his date;</span><br />
With a massic-laden ditty<br />
And a classic maiden pretty,<br />
He painted up the city,<br />

"Was ekil to Podunk, I tell yu."<br />

If they told him of Italy's sunny clime,<br />
"Maine kin beat it, every time!"<br />
If they marvelled at &AElig;tna's fount of fire,<br />
They roused his ire:<br />
With an injured air<br />
He'd reply, "I swear<br />
I don't think much of a smokin' hill;<br />
We've got a moderate little rill<br />
Kin make yer old volcaner still;<br />
Jes' pour old Kennebec down the crater,<br />
'N' I guess it'll cool her fiery nater!"<br />

"'Twan't up to the tavern daddy kept."<br />

Here they plied him with draughts of wine,<br />
Though he vowed old cider was twice as fine,<br />
Till the fumes of Falernian filled his head,<br />
And he slept as sound as the silent dead;<br />
They removed a mummy to make him room,<br />
And laid him at length in the rocky tomb.<br />
<br />
They piled old skeletons round the stone,<br />
Set a "dip" in a candlestick of bone,<br />
And left him to slumber there alone;<br />
Then watched from a distance the taper's gleam,<br />
Waiting to jeer at his frightened scream,<br />
When he should wake from his drunken dream.<br />
<br />
After a time the Yankee woke,<br />
But instantly saw through the flimsy joke;<br />
So never a cry or shout he uttered,<br />
But solemnly rose, and slowly muttered:<br />
"I see how it is. It's the judgment day,<br />
We've all been dead and stowed away;<br />
All these stone furreners sleepin' yet,<br />

<h3>THE BIRTH OF SAINT PATRICK</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
On the eighth day of March it was, some people say,<br />
That Saint Pathrick at midnight he first saw the day;<br />
While others declare 'twas the ninth he was born,<br />
And 'twas all a mistake between midnight and morn;<br />
For mistakes <i>will</i> occur in a hurry and shock,<br />
And some blam'd the baby&mdash;and some blam'd the clock&mdash;<br />
Till with all their cross-questions sure no one could know,<br />
If the child was too fast&mdash;or the clock was too slow.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>

<br />
Now the first faction fight in ould Ireland, they say,<br />
Was all on account of Saint Pathrick's birthday,<br />
Some fought for the eighth&mdash;for the ninth more would die.<br />
And who wouldn't see right, sure they blacken'd his eye!<br />
At last, <i>both</i> the factions so positive grew,<br />
That <i>each</i> kept a birthday, so Pat then had <i>two</i>,<br />
Till Father Mulcahy, who showed them their sins,<br />
Said, "No one could have two birthdays but a <i>twins</i>."<br />
<br />
Says he, "Boys, don't be fightin' for eight or for nine,<br />
Don't be always dividin'&mdash;but sometimes combine;<br />
Combine eight with nine, and seventeen is the mark,<br />
So let that be his birthday."&mdash;"Amen," says the clerk.<br />
"If he wasn't a <i>twins</i>, sure our hist'ry will show&mdash;<br />
That, at least, he's worth any <i>two</i> saints that we know!"<br />
Then they all got blind dhrunk&mdash;which complated their bliss,<br />
And we keep up the practice from that day to this.<br />

Her little feet! ... Beneath us ranged the sea,<br />

One shoe above the other danglingly,<br />

Brown rings and white, distracting&mdash;to the knee!<br />
<br />
The band was loud. A wild waltz melody<br />

And thro' my dream went pulsing fast and free:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Her little feet.</span><br />

Till she made room for some one. It was He!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A port-wine flavored He, a He who traded,</span><br />
Rich, rosy, round, obese to a degree!<br />
A sense of injury overmastered me.<br />

<h3>"EXACTLY SO"</h3>

A speech, both pithy and concise,<br />
Marks a mind acute and wise;<br />
What speech, my friend, say, do you know,<br />
Can stand before "Exactly so?"<br />
<br />
I have a dear and witty friend<br />
Who turns this phrase to every end;<br />
None can deny that "Yes" or "No"<br />
Is meant in this "Exactly so."<br />
<br />
Or when a bore his ear assails,<br />
Good-humour in his bosom fails,<br />
No response from his lips will flow,<br />
Save, now and then, "Exactly so."<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>

<br />
Is there remark on matters grave<br />
That he may wish perchance to waive,<br />
Or thinks perhaps is rather slow,<br />
He stops it by "Exactly so."<br />
<br />
It saves the trouble of a thought&mdash;<br />
No sour dispute can thence be sought;<br />
It leaves the thing in <i>statu quo</i>,<br />
This beautiful "Exactly so."<br />
<br />
It has another charm, this phrase,<br />
For it implies the speaker's praise<br />
Of what has just been said&mdash;<i>ergo</i>&mdash;<br />
It pleases, this "Exactly so."<br />
<br />
Nor need the conscience feel distress,<br />
By answ'ring wrongly "No" or "Yes;"<br />
It 'scapes a falsehood, which is low,<br />
And substitutes "Exactly so."<br />
<br />
Each mortal loves to think he's right,<br />
That his opinion, too, is bright;<br />
Then, Christian, you may soothe your foe<br />
By chiming in "Exactly so."<br />
<br />
Whoe'er these lines may chance peruse,<br />
Of this famed word will see the use,<br />
And mention where'er he may go,<br />
The praises of "Exactly so."<br />
<br />
Of this more could my muse relate,<br />
But you, kind reader, I'll not sate;<br />
For if I did you'd cry "Hallo!<br />
I've heard enough"&mdash;"Exactly so."<br />

I know not of what we ponder'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or made pretty pretence to talk,</span><br />
As, her hand within mine, we wander'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tow'rd the pool by the lime-tree walk,</span><br />
While the dew fell in showers from the passion flowers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the blush-rose bent on her stalk.</span><br />
<br />
I cannot recall her figure:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was it regal as Juno's own?</span><br />
Or only a trifle bigger<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than the elves who surround the throne</span><br />
Of the Fa&euml;ry Queen, and are seen, I ween,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By mortals in dreams alone?</span><br />
<br />
What her eyes were like, I know not:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Perhaps they were blurr'd with tears;</span><br />
And perhaps in your skies there glow not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(On the contrary) clearer spheres.</span><br />
No! as to her eyes I am just as wise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As you or the cat, my dears.</span><br />
<br />
Her teeth, I presume, were "pearly":<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But which was she, brunette or blonde?</span><br />
Her hair, was it quaintly curly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or as straight as a beadle's wand?</span><br />
That I fail'd to remark;&mdash;it was rather dark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shadowy round the pond.</span><br />
<br />
Then the hand that reposed so snugly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In mine,&mdash;was it plump or spare?</span><br />
Was the countenance fair or ugly?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nay, children, you have me there!</span><br />
<i>My</i> eyes were p'r'aps blurr'd; and besides I'd heard<br />

And I&mdash;was I brusque and surly?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or oppressively bland and fond?</span><br />
Was I partial to rising early?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or why did we twain abscond,</span><br />
All breakfastless, too, from the public view,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To prowl by a misty pond?</span><br />
<br />
What pass'd, what was felt or spoken&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whether anything pass'd at all&mdash;</span><br />
And whether the heart was broken<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That beat under that shelt'ring shawl&mdash;</span><br />
(If shawl she had on, which I doubt)&mdash;has gone,<br />

Ask your governess, dears, or tutor.<br />

And wrings the Bel and toles it when men dyes<br />
to the grief of survivin pardners, and sweeps pathes;<br />
And for the servases gits $100 per annum,<br />
Which them that thinks deer, let em try it;<br />
Getting up be foar star-lite in all weathers and<br />
Kindlin-fires when the wether it is cold<br />

Each one mus take whatever comes to him,<br />
O sextant, don't you know our lungs is bellusses,<br />
To blo the fier of life, and keep it from<br />

<h3>THE POPE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
The Pope he leads a happy life,<br />
He fears not married care nor strife.<br />
He drinks the best of Rhenish wine,&mdash;<br />
I would the Pope's gay lot were mine.<br />
<br />
But yet all happy's not his life,<br />
He has no maid, nor blooming wife;<br />
No child has he to raise his hope,&mdash;<br />
I would not wish to be the Pope.<br />
<br />
The Sultan better pleases me,<br />
His is a life of jollity;<br />
He's wives as many as he will,&mdash;<br />
I would the Sultan's throne then fill.<br />
<br />
But even he's a wretched man,<br />
He must obey the Alcoran;<br />
He dare not drink one drop of wine&mdash;<br />
I would not change his lot for mine.<br />
<br />
So here I'll take my lowly stand,<br />
I'll drink my own, my native land;<br />
I'll kiss my maiden fair and fine,<br />
And drink the best of Rhenish wine.<br />
<br />
And when my maiden kisses me<br />
I'll think that I the Sultan be;<br />
And when my cheery glass I tope,<br />
I'll fancy then I am the Pope.<br />

<h3>ALL AT SEA</h3>
<h4>THE VOYAGE OF A CERTAIN UNCERTAIN SAILORMAN</h4>

I saw a certain sailorman who sat beside the sea,<br />
And in the manner of his tribe he yawned this yarn to me:<br />

"'Twere back in eighteen-fifty-three, or mebbe fifty-four,<br />
I skipped the farm,&mdash;no, 't were the shop,&mdash;an' went to Baltimore.<br />
I shipped aboard the <i>Lizzie</i>&mdash;or she might ha' bin the <i>Jane;</i><br />
Them wimmin names are mixey, so I don't remember plain;<br />
But anyhow, she were a craft that carried schooner rig,<br />
(Although Sam Swab, the bo'sun, allus swore she were a brig);<br />
We sailed away from Salem Town,&mdash;no, lemme think;&mdash;'t were <i>Lynn</i>,&mdash;<br />
An' steered a course for Africa (or Greece, it might ha' bin);<br />
But anyway, we tacked an' backed an' weathered many a storm&mdash;<br />
Oh, no,&mdash;as I recall it now, that week was fine an' warm!<br />
Who did I say the cap'n was? I <i>didn't</i> say at all?<br />
Wa-a-ll now, his name were 'Lijah Bell&mdash;or was it Eli Ball?<br />
I kinder guess 't were Eli. He'd a big, red, bushy beard&mdash;<br />
No-o-o, come to think, he allus kept <i>his</i> whiskers nicely sheared.<br />
<br />
But anyhow, that voyage was the first I'd ever took,<br />
An' all I had to do was cut up cabbage for the cook;<br />
But come to talk o' cabbage just reminds me,&mdash;that there trip<br />
Would prob'ly be my <i>third</i> one, on a Hong Kong clipper-ship.<br />
<br />
The crew they were a jolly lot, an' used to sing '<i>Avast</i>,'<br />
I think it were, or else '<i>Ahoy</i>,' while bailing out the mast.<br />
And as I recollect it now,&mdash;"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">But here I cut him short,</span><br />
And said: "It's time to tack again, and bring your wits to port;<br />
I came to get a story both adventurous and <i>true</i>,<br />
And here is how I started out to write the interview:<br />
'I saw a <i>certain</i> sailorman,' but you turn out to be<br />
The most <i>un</i>-certain sailorman that ever sailed the sea!"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>

He puffed his pipe, and answered, "Wa-a-ll, I <i>thought</i> 'twere mine, but still,<br />
<i>I must ha' told the one belongs to my twin brother Bill</i>!"<br />

For a tropical country far away,<br />

And now as he looked at the ship she was in<br />

He watched as the good ship cut the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bumpishly up-and-downed,</span><br />
And thought if already she qualmish might be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He'd consider his happiness crowned.</span><br />

He watched till beneath the horizon's edge<br />

And he sprang to the top of a rocky ledge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pranced like a kangaroo.</span><br />
<br />
He watched till the vessel became a speck<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That was lost in the wandering sea;</span><br />
And then, at the risk of breaking his neck,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turned somersaults home to tea.</span><br />

In these days of indigestion<br />
It is oftentimes a question<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As to what to eat and what to leave alone;</span><br />
For each microbe and bacillus<br />
Has a different way to kill us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in time they always claim us for their own.</span><br />
There are germs of every kind<br />
In any food that you can find<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the market or upon the bill of fare.</span><br />
Drinking water's just as risky<br />
As the so-called deadly whiskey,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it's often a mistake to breathe the air.</span><br />
<br />
Some little bug is going to find you some day,<br />
Some little bug will creep behind you some day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then he'll send for his bug friends</span><br />

The inviting green cucumber<br />
Gets most everybody's number,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the green corn has a system of its own;</span><br />
Though a radish seems nutritious<br />
Its behaviour is quite vicious,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a doctor will be coming to your home.</span><br />
Eating lobster cooked or plain<br />
Is only flirting with ptomaine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While an oyster sometimes has a lot to say,</span><br />
But the clams we eat in chowder<br />
Make the angels chant the louder,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For they know that we'll be with them right away.</span><br />
<br />
Take a slice of nice fried onion<br />
And you're fit for Dr. Munyon,<br />

Chew a cheesy midnight "rabbit"<br />
And a grave you'll soon inhabit&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, to eat at all is such a foolish game.</span><br />
Eating huckleberry pie<br />
Is a pleasing way to die,<br />

If a stomach pump is handy<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the grave digger makes a note upon his cuff.</span><br />
Eat that lovely red bologna<br />
And you'll wear a wooden kimona,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As your relatives start scrappin 'bout your stuff.</span><br />
<br />
Some little bug is going to find you some day,<br />
Some little bug will creep behind you some day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Eating juicy sliced pineapple</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Makes the sexton dust the chapel;</span><br />
Some little bug is going to find you some day.<br />
<br />
All those crazy foods they mix<br />
Will float us 'cross the River Styx,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or they'll start us climbing up the milky way.</span><br />
And the meals we eat in courses<br />
Mean a hearse and two black horses<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So before a meal some people always pray.</span><br />
Luscious grapes breed 'pendicitis,<br />
And the juice leads to gastritis,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So there's only death to greet us either way;</span><br />
And fried liver's nice, but, mind you,<br />
Friends will soon ride slow behind you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the papers then will have nice things to say.</span><br />
<br />
Some little bug is going to find you some day,<br />
Some little bug will creep behind you some day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Eat some sauce, they call it chili,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On your breast they'll place a lily;</span><br />
Some little bug is going to find you some day.<br />

<h3>REPORT OF AN ADJUDGED CASE</h3>
<h4>NOT TO BE FOUND IN ANY OF THE BOOKS</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The spectacles set them unhappily wrong;</span><br />
The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To which the said spectacles ought to belong.</span><br />
<br />
So Tongue was the lawyer, and argued the cause<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a great deal of skill, and a wig full of learning;</span><br />
While chief baron Ear sat to balance the laws,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So famed for his talent in nicely discerning.</span><br />
<br />
In behalf of the Nose it will quickly appear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And your lordship, he said, will undoubtedly find,</span><br />
That the Nose has had spectacles always to wear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which amounts to possession time out of mind.</span><br />
<br />
Then holding the spectacles up to the court&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your lordship observes they are made with a straddle</span><br />
As wide as the ridge of the Nose is; in short,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Designed to sit close to it, just like a saddle.</span><br />
<br />
Again, would your lordship a moment suppose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">('Tis a case that has happened, and may be again)</span><br />
That the visage or countenance had not a nose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pray who would, or who could, wear spectacles then!</span><br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>

On the whole it appears, and my argument shows<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a reasoning the court will never condemn,</span><br />
That the spectacles plainly were made for the Nose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Nose was as plainly intended for them.</span><br />
<br />
Then shifting his side (as a lawyer knows how),<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes;</span><br />
But what were his arguments few people know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the court did not think they were equally wise.</span><br />
<br />
So his lordship decreed with a grave solemn tone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Decisive and clear, without one <i>if</i> or <i>but</i>&mdash;</span><br />
That, whenever the Nose put his spectacles on,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By daylight or candlelight&mdash;Eyes should be shut!</span><br />

<p>
A man sat on a rock and sought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Refreshment from his thumb;</span><br />
A dinotherium wandered by<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scared him some.</span><br />
<br />
His name was Smith. The kind of rock<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He sat upon was shale.</span><br />
One feature quite distinguished him&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He had a tail.</span><br />
<br />
The danger past, he fell into<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A revery austere;</span><br />
While with his tail he whisked a fly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From off his ear.</span><br />
<br />
"Mankind deteriorates," he said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Grows weak and incomplete;</span><br />
And each new generation seems<br />

<br />
"But fashion's dictates rule supreme,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ignoring common sense;</span><br />
And fashion says, to dock your tail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is just immense.</span><br />
<br />
"And children now come in the world<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With half a tail or less;</span><br />
Too stumpy to convey a thought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And meaningless.</span><br />
<br />
"It kills expression. How can one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Set forth, in words that drag,</span><br />
The best emotions of the soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without a wag?"</span><br />
<br />
Sadly he mused upon the world,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its follies and its woes;</span><br />
Then wiped the moisture from his eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And blew his nose.</span><br />
<br />
But clothed in earrings, Mrs. Smith<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came wandering down the dale;</span><br />
And, smiling, Mr. Smith arose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wagged his tail.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And chiefly in losing the caudal appendage.</span><br />
<br />
Our ancestors' holding was wholly <i>in tail</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the loss of this feature we claim as a merit;</span><br />
But though often at tale-bearing people we rail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis rather a loss than a gain we inherit.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span></p>

<p>
The tail was a rudder&mdash;a capital thing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To a man who was half&mdash;or a quarter&mdash;seas over;</span><br />
And as for a sailor, by that he could cling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And use for his hands and his feet both discover.</span><br />
<br />
In the Arts it would quickly have found out a place;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The painter would use it to steady his pencil;</span><br />
In music, how handy to pound at the bass!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then one could write by its coilings prehensile.</span><br />
<br />
The Army had gained had the fashion endured&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twould carry a sword, or be good in saluting;</span><br />
If the foe should turn tail, they'd be quickly secured;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or, used as a lasso, 'twould help in recruiting.</span><br />
<br />
To the Force 'twould add force&mdash;they could "run 'em in" so<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That one to three culprits would find himself equal;</span><br />
He could collar the two, have the other in tow&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A very good form of the Tale and its Sequel.</span><br />
<br />
In life many uses 'twould serve we should see&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A man with no bed could hang cosily snoozing;</span><br />
'Twould hold an umbrella, hand cups round at tea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or a candle support while our novel perusing.</span><br />
<br />
In fact, when one thinks of our loss from of old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It makes us regret that we can't go in for it, or</span><br />
Wish, like the Dane, we a <i>tail</i> could unfold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Instead of remaining each one a <i>stump</i> orator.</span><br />

<h3>SALAD</h3>

<p>
To make this condiment, your poet begs<br />
The pounded yellow of two hard-boiled eggs;<br />
Two boiled potatoes, passed through kitchen-sieve,<br />
Smoothness and softness to the salad give;<br />
Let onion atoms lurk within the bowl,<br />
And, half-suspected, animate the whole.<br />
Of mordant mustard add a single spoon,<br />
Distrust the condiment that bites so soon;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>

But deem it not, thou man of herbs, a fault,<br />
To add a double quantity of salt.<br />
And, lastly, o'er the flavored compound toss<br />
A magic soup-spoon of anchovy sauce.<br />
Oh, green and glorious! Oh, herbaceous treat!<br />
'Twould tempt the dying anchorite to eat;<br />
Back to the world he'd turn his fleeting soul,<br />
And plunge his fingers in the salad bowl!<br />
Serenely full, the epicure would say,<br />
Fate can not harm me, I have dined to-day!<br />

<p>
Three score and ten by common calculation<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The years of man amount to; but we'll say</span><br />
He turns four-score, yet, in my estimation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In all those years he has not lived a day.</span><br />
<br />
Out of the eighty you must first remember<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hours of night you pass asleep in bed;</span><br />
And, counting from December to December,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just half your life you'll find you have been dead.</span><br />
<br />
To forty years at once by this reduction<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We come; and sure, the first five from your birth,</span><br />
While cutting teeth and living upon suction,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You're not alive to what this life is worth.</span><br />
<br />
From thirty-five next take for education<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fifteen at least at college and at school;</span><br />
When, notwithstanding all your application,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The chances are you may turn out a fool.</span><br />
<br />
Still twenty we have left us to dispose of,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But during them your fortune you've to make;</span><br />
And granting, with the luck of some one knows of,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis made in ten&mdash;that's ten from life to take.</span><br />
<br />
Out of the ten yet left you must allow for<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The time for shaving, tooth and other aches,</span><br />
Say four&mdash;and that leaves, six, too short, I vow, for<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Regretting past and making fresh mistakes.</span><br />
<br />
Meanwhile each hour dispels some fond illusion;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until at length, sans eyes, sans teeth, you may</span><br />
Have scarcely sense to come to this conclusion&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You've reached four-score, but haven't lived a day!</span><br />

He came to the Emerald Isle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a lump of a paving-stone mounted;</span><br />
The steamboat he beat by a mile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which mighty good sailing was counted.</span><br />
Says he, "The salt water, I think,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has made me most bloodily thirsty;</span><br />
So bring me a flagon of drink<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To keep down the mulligrubs, burst ye!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of drink that is fit for a saint!"</span><br />
<br />
He preached, then, with wonderful force,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ignorant natives a-teaching;</span><br />
With a pint he washed down his discourse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For," says he, "I detest your dry preaching."</span><br />
The people, with wonderment struck<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At a pastor so pious and civil,</span><br />
Exclaimed&mdash;"We're for you, my old buck!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we pitch our blind gods to the devil,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who dwells in hot water below!"</span><br />
<br />
This ended, our worshipful spoon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went to visit an elegant fellow,</span><br />
Whose practice, each cool afternoon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was to get most delightfully mellow.</span><br />
That day with a black-jack of beer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It chanced he was treating a party;</span><br />
Says the saint&mdash;"This good day, do you hear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I drank nothing to speak of, my hearty!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So give me a pull at the pot!"</span><br />

The pewter he lifted in sport<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Believe me, I tell you no fable);</span><br />
A gallon he drank from the quart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then placed it full on the table.</span><br />
"A miracle!" every one said&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they all took a haul at the stingo;</span><br />
They were capital hands at the trade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drank till they fell; yet, by jingo,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The pot still frothed over the brim.</span><br />
<br />
Next day, quoth his host, "'Tis a fast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I've nought in my larder but mutton;</span><br />
And on Fridays who'd made such repast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Except an unchristian-like glutton?"</span><br />

Take my compliments down to the leg,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bid it come hither a salmon!"</span><br />

You've heard, I suppose, long ago,<br />

He marched to the county Mayo,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And trundled them into th' Atlantic.</span><br />
Hence, not to use water for drink,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The people of Ireland determine&mdash;</span><br />
With mighty good reason, I think,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since St. Patrick has filled it with vermin</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And vipers, and other such stuff!</span><br />
<br />
Oh, he was an elegant blade<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As you'd meet from Fairhead to Kilcrumper;</span><br />
And though under the sod he is laid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet here goes his health in a bumper!</span><br />
I wish he was here, that my glass<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He might by art magic replenish;</span><br />
But since he is not&mdash;why, alas!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My ditty must come to a finish,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Because all the liquor is out!</span><br />

<h3>REFLECTIONS ON CLEOPATHERA'S NEEDLE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
So that's Cleopathera's Needle, bedad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' a quare lookin' needle it is, I'll be bound;</span><br />
What a powerful muscle the queen must have had<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That could grasp such a weapon an' wind it around!</span><br />
<br />
Imagine her sittin' there stitchin' like mad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wid a needle like that in her hand! I declare</span><br />
It's as big as the Round Tower of Slane, an', bedad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It would pass for a round tower, only it's square!</span><br />
<br />
The taste of her, ordherin' a needle of granite!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Begorra, the sight of it sthrikes me quite dumb!</span><br />
An' look at the quare sort of figures upon it;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I wondher can these be the thracks of her thumb!</span><br />
<br />
I once was astonished to hear of the faste<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cleopathera made upon pearls; but now</span><br />
I declare, I would not be surprised in the laste<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If ye told me the woman had swallowed a cow!</span><br />
<br />
It's aisy to see why bould C&aelig;sar should quail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In her presence, an' meekly submit to her rule;</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>

Wid a weapon like that in her fist I'll go bail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She could frighten the sowl out of big Finn MacCool!</span><br />
<br />
But, Lord, what poor pigmies the women are now,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Compared with the monsthers they must have been then!</span><br />
Whin the darlin's in those days would kick up a row,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Holy smoke, but it must have been hot for the men!</span><br />
<br />
Just think how a chap that goes courtin' would start<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If his girl was to prod him wid that in the shins!</span><br />
I have often seen needles, but bouldly assart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the needle in front of me there takes the pins!</span><br />
<br />
O, sweet Cleopathera! I'm sorry you're dead;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' whin lavin' this wondherful needle behind</span><br />
Had ye thought of bequathin' a spool of your thread<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' yer thimble an' scissors, it would have been kind.</span><br />
<br />
But pace to your ashes, ye plague of great men,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yer strength is departed, yer glory is past;</span><br />
Ye'll never wield sceptre or needle again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' a poor little asp did yer bizzness at last!</span><br />

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF IRELAND</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
With due condescension, I'd call your attention<br />
To what I shall mention of Erin so green,<br />
And without hesitation I will show how that nation<br />
Became of creation the gem and the queen.<br />
<br />
'Twas early one morning, without any warning,<br />
That Vanus was born in the beautiful say,<br />
And by the same token, and sure 'twas provoking,<br />
Her pinions were soaking and wouldn't give play.<br />
<br />
Old Neptune, who knew her, began to pursue her,<br />
In order to woo her&mdash;the wicked old Jew&mdash;<br />
And almost had caught her atop of the water&mdash;<br />
Great Jupiter's daughter!&mdash;which never would do.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span></p>

<p>
But Jove, the great janius, looked down and saw Vanus,<br />
And Neptune so heinous pursuing her wild,<br />
And he spoke out in thunder, he'd rend him asunder&mdash;<br />
And sure 'twas no wonder&mdash;for tazing his child.<br />
<br />
A star that was flying hard by him espying,<br />
He caught with small trying, and down let it snap;<br />
It fell quick as winking, on Neptune a-sinking,<br />
And gave him, I'm thinking, a bit of a rap.<br />
<br />
That star it was dry land, both low land and high land,<br />
And formed a sweet island, the land of my birth;<br />
Thus plain is the story, that sent down from glory,<br />
Old Erin asthore as the gem of the earth!<br />
<br />
Upon Erin nately jumped Vanus so stately,<br />
But fainted, kase lately so hard she was pressed&mdash;<br />
Which much did bewilder, but ere it had killed her<br />
Her father distilled her a drop of the best.<br />
<br />
That sup was victorious, it made her feel glorious&mdash;<br />
A little uproarious, I fear it might prove&mdash;<br />
So how can you blame us that Ireland's so famous<br />
For drinking and beauty, for fighting and love?<br />

<h3>THE TWINS</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
In form and feature, face and limb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I grew so like my brother,</span><br />
That folks got taking me for him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And each for one another.</span><br />
It puzzled all our kith and kin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It reach'd an awful pitch;</span><br />
For one of us was born a twin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet not a soul knew which.</span><br />
<br />
One day (to make the matter worse),<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before our names were fix'd,</span><br />
As we were being wash'd by nurse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We got completely mix'd;</span><br />
And thus, you see, by Fate's decree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Or rather nurse's whim),</span><br />
My brother John got christen'd <i>me</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I got christen'd <i>him</i>.</span><br />
<br />
This fatal likeness even dogg'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My footsteps when at school,</span><br />
And I was always getting flogg'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For John turned out a fool.</span><br />
I put this question hopelessly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To every one I knew&mdash;</span><br />
What <i>would</i> you do, if you were me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To prove that you were <i>you</i>?</span><br />
<br />
Our close resemblance turn'd the tide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of my domestic life;</span><br />
For somehow my intended bride<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Became my brother's wife.</span><br />
In short, year after year the same<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Absurd mistakes went on;</span><br />
And when I died&mdash;the neighbors came<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And buried brother John!</span><br />

<h3>BLOW ME EYES!</h3>

When I was young and full o' pride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A-standin' on the grass</span><br />
And gazin' o'er the water-side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I seen a fisher lass.</span><br />
"O, fisher lass, be kind awhile,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I asks 'er quite unbid.</span><br />
"Please look into me face and smile"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, blow me eyes, she did!</span><br />
<br />
O, blow me light and blow me blow,<br />
I didn't think she'd charm me so&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, blow me eyes, she did!</span><br />
<br />
She seemed so young and beautiful<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I <i>had</i> to speak perlite,</span><br />
(The afternoon was long and dull,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But she was short and bright).</span><br />
"This ain't no place," I says, "to stand&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let's take a walk instid,</span><br />
Each holdin' of the other's hand"&mdash;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With no one else to see,</span><br />
Me heart was filled with sudden pain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so I says to she:</span><br />
"If you would have me actions speak<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The words what can't be hid,</span><br />
You'd sort o' let me kiss yer cheek"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, blow me eyes, she did!</span><br />
<br />
O, blow me light and blow me blow,<br />
How sweet she was I didn't know&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, blow me eyes, <i>she</i> did!</span><br />
<br />
But pretty soon me shipmate Jim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came strollin' down the beach,</span><br />
And she began a-oglin' him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As pretty as a peach.</span><br />
"O, fickle maid o' false intent,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Impulsively I chid,</span><br />
"Why don't you go and wed that gent?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, blow me eyes, she did!</span><br />

O, blow me light and blow me blow,<br />
I didn't think she'd treat me so&mdash;<br />

<h3>FIRST LOVE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
O my earliest love, who, ere I number'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ten sweet summers, made my bosom thrill!</span><br />
Will a swallow&mdash;or a swift, or some bird&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fly to her and say, I love her still?</span><br />
<br />
Say my life's a desert drear and arid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To its one green spot I aye recur:</span><br />
Never, never&mdash;although three times married&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have I cared a jot for aught but her.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>

<br />
No, mine own! though early forced to leave you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still my heart was there where first we met;</span><br />
In those "Lodgings with an ample sea-view,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which were, forty years ago, "To Let."</span><br />
<br />
There I saw her first, our landlord's oldest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little daughter. On a thing so fair</span><br />
Thou, O Sun,&mdash;who (so they say) beholdest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Everything,&mdash;hast gazed, I tell thee, ne'er.</span><br />
<br />
There she sat&mdash;so near me, yet remoter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than a star&mdash;a blue-eyed, bashful imp:</span><br />
On her lap she held a happy bloater,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twixt her lips a yet more happy shrimp.</span><br />
<br />
And I loved her, and our troth we plighted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the morrow by the shingly shore:</span><br />
In a fortnight to be disunited<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By a bitter fate forevermore.</span><br />
<br />
O my own, my beautiful, my blue-eyed!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To be young once more, and bite my thumb</span><br />
At the world and all its cares with you, I'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Give no inconsiderable sum.</span><br />
<br />
Hand in hand we tramp'd the golden seaweed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon as o'er the gray cliff peep'd the dawn:</span><br />
Side by side, when came the hour for tea, we'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crunch the mottled shrimp and hairy prawn:&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Has she wedded some gigantic shrimper,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sweet mite with whom I loved to play?</span><br />
Is she girt with babes that whine and whimper,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That bright being who was always gay?</span><br />
<br />
Yes&mdash;she has at least a dozen wee things!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yes&mdash;I see her darning corduroys,</span><br />
Scouring floors, and setting out the tea-things,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a howling herd of hungry boys,</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>

<br />
In a home that reeks of tar and sperm-oil!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But at intervals she thinks, I know,</span><br />
Of those days which we, afar from turmoil,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spent together forty years ago.</span><br />
<br />
O my earliest love, still unforgotten,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With your downcast eyes of dreamy blue!</span><br />
Never, somehow, could I seem to cotton<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To another as I did to you!</span><br />

<h3>BESSIE BROWN, M.D.</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
'Twas April when she came to town;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The birds had come; the bees were swarming.</span><br />
Her name, she said, was Doctor Brown;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I saw at once that she was charming.</span><br />
She took a cottage tinted green,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where dewy roses loved to mingle;</span><br />
And on the door, next day, was seen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dainty little shingle.</span><br />
<br />
Her hair was like an amber wreath;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her hat was darker, to enhance it.</span><br />
The violet eyes that glowed beneath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were brighter than her keenest lancet,</span><br />
The beauties of her glove and gown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sweetest rhyme would fail to utter.</span><br />
Ere she had been a day in town<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The town was in a flutter.</span><br />
<br />
The gallants viewed her feet and hands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And swore they never saw such wee things;</span><br />
The gossips met in purring bands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tore her piecemeal o'er the tea-things.</span><br />
The former drank the Doctor's health<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With clinking cups, the gay carousers;</span><br />
The latter watched her door by stealth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Just like so many mousers.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>

<br />
But Doctor Bessie went her way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unmindful of the spiteful cronies,</span><br />
And drove her buggy every day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Behind a dashing pair of ponies.</span><br />
Her flower-like face so bright she bore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I hoped that time might never wilt her.</span><br />
The way she tripped across the floor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was better than a philter.</span><br />
<br />
Her patients thronged the village street;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her snowy slate was always quite full.</span><br />
Some said her bitters tasted sweet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some pronounced her pills delightful.</span><br />
'Twas strange&mdash;I knew not what it meant&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She seemed a nymph from Eldorado;</span><br />
Where'er she came, where'er she went,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Grief lost its gloomy shadow.</span><br />
<br />
Like all the rest I, too, grew ill;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My aching heart there was no quelling.</span><br />
I tremble at my doctor's bill&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lo! the items still are swelling.</span><br />
The drugs I've drunk you'd weep to hear!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They've quite enriched the fair concocter,</span><br />
And I'm a ruined man, I fear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Unless&mdash;I wed the Doctor!</span><br />

I've seen kind eyes not new to tears,<br />
A form of grace, though full of years&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her fifty summers have left no flaw&mdash;</span><br />
And I, a youth of twenty-three,<br />
So love this lady, fair to see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I want her for my mother-in-law!</span><br />
<br />
Over the way, over the way,<br />
I've seen her with the children play;<br />
I've seen her with a royal grace<br />
Before the mirror adjust her lace;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A kinder woman none ever saw;</span><br />
God bless and cheer her onward path,<br />
And bless all treasures that she hath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And let her be my mother-in-law!</span><br />
<br />
Over the way, over the way,<br />
I think I'll venture, dear, some day<br />
(If you will lend a helping hand,<br />
And sanctify the scheme I've planned);<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll kneel in loving, reverent awe</span><br />
Down at the lady's feet, and say:<br />
"I've loved your daughter many a day&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Please won't you be my mother-in-law?"</span><br />

<h3>CHORUS OF WOMEN</h3>

<h4>FROM THE "THESMOPHORIAZUS&AElig;."</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
They're always abusing the women,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As a terrible plague to men;</span><br />
They say we're the root of all evil,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And repeat it again and again&mdash;</span><br />
Of war, and quarrels, and bloodshed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All mischief, be what it may.</span><br />
And pray, then, why do you marry us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If we're all the plagues you say?</span><br />
And why do you take such care of us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And keep us so safe at home,</span><br />
And are never easy a moment<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If ever we chance to roam?</span><br />
When you ought to be thanking Heaven<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That your plague is out of the way,</span><br />
You all keep fussing and fretting&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Where is my Plague to-day?"</span><br />
If a Plague peeps out of the window,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up go the eyes of men;</span><br />
If she hides, then they all keep staring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until she looks out again.</span><br />

<h3>THE SMACK IN SCHOOL</h3>

<p>
A district school, not far away,<br />
Mid Berkshire's hills, one winter's day,<br />
Was humming with its wonted noise<br />
Of threescore mingled girls and boys;<br />
Some few upon their tasks intent,<br />
But more on furtive mischief bent.<br />
The while the master's downward look<br />
Was fastened on a copy-book;<br />
When suddenly, behind his back,<br />
Rose sharp and clear a rousing smack!<br />
As 'twere a battery of bliss<br />
Let off in one tremendous kiss!<br />
"What's that?" the startled master cries;<br />
"That, thir," a little imp replies,<br />
"Wath William Willith, if you pleathe,&mdash;<br />
I thaw him kith Thuthanna Peathe!"<br />
With frown to make a statue thrill,<br />
The master thundered, "Hither, Will!"<br />
Like wretch o'ertaken in his track,<br />
With stolen chattels on his back,<br />
Will hung his head in fear and shame,<br />
And to the awful presence came,&mdash;<br />
A great, green, bashful simpleton,<br />
The butt of all good-natured fun.<br />
With smile suppressed, and birch upraised,<br />
The thunderer faltered,&mdash;"I'm amazed<br />
That you, my biggest pupil, should<br />

Be guilty of an act so rude!<br />
Before the whole set school to boot&mdash;<br />
What evil genius put you to't?"<br />
"'Twas she herself, sir," sobbed the lad,<br />
"I did not mean to be so bad;<br />
But when Susannah shook her curls,<br />
And whispered, I was 'fraid of girls<br />
And dursn't kiss a baby's doll,<br />
I couldn't stand it, sir, at all,<br />
But up and kissed her on the spot!<br />
I know&mdash;boo&mdash;hoo&mdash;I ought to not,<br />
But, somehow, from her looks&mdash;boo&mdash;hoo&mdash;<br />
I thought she kind o' wished me to!"<br />

As beautiful Kitty one morning was tripping,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a pitcher of milk from the fair of Coleraine,</span><br />
When she saw me she stumbled, the pitcher it tumbled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the sweet buttermilk water'd the plain.</span><br />
<br />
"O, what shall I do now, 'twas looking at you now,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sure, sure, such a pitcher I'll ne'er meet again!</span><br />
'Twas the pride of my dairy: O Barney M'Cleary!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You're sent as a plague to the girls of Coleraine."</span><br />
<br />
I sat down beside her,&mdash;and gently did chide her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That such a misfortune should give her such pain;</span><br />
A kiss then I gave her,&mdash;and ere I did leave her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She vow'd for such pleasure she'd break it again.</span><br />
<br />
'Twas hay-making season, I can't tell the reason,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Misfortunes will never come single,&mdash;that's plain,</span><br />
For, very soon after poor Kitty's disaster,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make a proper match;</span><br />
For coronets and eldest sons,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>

I've hopes when some <i>distingu&eacute;</i> beau<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A glance upon me throws;</span><br />
But though he'll dance and smile and flirt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Alas! he won't propose.</span><br />
<br />
I've tried to win by languishing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dressing like a blue;</span><br />
I've bought big books and talked of them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if I'd read them through!</span><br />

But Spurzheim could not touch their hearts,<br />

I threw aside the books, and thought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That ignorance was bliss;</span><br />
I felt convinced that men preferred<br />

<h3>A PIN</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Oh, I know a certain woman who is reckoned with the good,<br />
But she fills me with more terror than a raging lion would.<br />
The little chills run up and down my spine when'er we meet,<br />
Though she seems a gentle creature and she's very trim and neat.<br />
<br />
And she has a thousand virtues and not one acknowledged sin,<br />
But she is the sort of person you could liken to a pin,<br />
And she pricks you, and she sticks you, in a way that can't be said&mdash;<br />
When you seek for what has hurt you, why, you cannot find the head.<br />
<br />
But she fills you with discomfort and exasperating pain&mdash;<br />
If anybody asks you why, you really can't explain.<br />
A pin is such a tiny thing,&mdash;of that there is no doubt,&mdash;<br />
Yet when it's sticking in your flesh, you're wretched till it's out!<br />
<br />
She is wonderfully observing&mdash;when she meets a pretty girl<br />
She is always sure to tell her if her "bang" is out of curl.<br />
And she is so sympathetic: to a friend, who's much admired,<br />
She is often heard remarking, "Dear, you look so worn and tired!"<br />
<br />
And she is a careful critic; for on yesterday she eyed<br />
The new dress I was airing with a woman's natural pride,<br />
And she said, "Oh, how becoming!" and then softly added, "It<br />
Is really a misfortune that the basque is such a fit."<br />
<br />
Then she said, "If you had heard me yestereve, I'm sure, my friend,<br />
You would say I am a champion who knows how to defend."<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>

And she left me with the feeling&mdash;most unpleasant, I aver&mdash;<br />
That the whole world would despise me if it had not been for her.<br />
<br />
Whenever I encounter her, in such a nameless way<br />
She gives me the impression I am at my worst that day,<br />
And the hat that was imported (and that cost me half a sonnet)<br />
With just one glance from her round eyes becomes a Bowery bonnet.<br />
<br />
She is always bright and smiling, sharp and shining for a thrust&mdash;<br />
Use does not seem to blunt her point, not does she gather rust&mdash;<br />
Oh! I wish some hapless specimen of mankind would begin<br />
To tidy up the world for me, by picking up this pin.<br />

"A favour so slight one's good-nature secures;"<br />

"I would blow it again," said the youth; "and the charm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would work so, that not even modesty's check</span><br />
Would be able to keep from my neck your white arm."<br />

From the tragic-est novels at Mudie's&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At least, on a practical plan&mdash;</span><br />
To the tales of mere Hodges and Judys,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One love is enough for a man.</span><br />
But no case that I ever yet met is<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like mine: I am equally fond</span><br />
Of Rose, who a charming brunette is,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">And Dora, a blonde.</span><br />
<br />
Each rivals the other in powers&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each waltzes, each warbles, each paints&mdash;</span><br />
Miss Rose, chiefly tumble-down towers;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Miss Do., perpendicular saints.</span><br />
In short, to distinguish is folly;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twixt the pair I am come to the pass</span><br />
Of Macheath, between Lucy and Polly,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">Or Buridan's ass.</span><br />
<br />
If it happens that Rosa I've singled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a soft celebration in rhyme,</span><br />
Then the ringlets of Dora get mingled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Somehow with the tune and the time;</span><br />
Or I painfully pen me a sonnet<br />

And behold I am writing upon it<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">The legend, "To Rose,"</span><br />
<br />
Or I try to draw Dora (my blotter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is all overscrawled with her head),</span><br />
If I fancy at last that I've got her,<br />

Or I find myself placidly adding<br />

Miss Dora's bud-mouth, and her madding<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">Ineffable nose.</span><br />
<br />
Was there ever so sad a dilemma?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Rose I would perish (pro tem.);</span><br />
For Dora I'd willingly stem a&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Whatever might offer to stem);</span><br />
But to make the invidious election,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To declare that on either one's side</span><br />
I've a scruple,&mdash;a grain, more affection,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">I <i>cannot</i> decide.</span><br />
<br />
And, as either so hopelessly nice is,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My sole and my final resource</span><br />
Is to wait some indefinite crisis,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some feat of molecular force,</span><br />
To solve me this riddle conducive<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By no means to peace or repose,</span><br />
Since the issue can scarce be inclusive<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">Of Dora <i>and</i> Rose.</span><br />
</p>
<p class='center'>(<i>Afterthought</i>)</p>
<p>
But, perhaps, if a third (say a Nora),<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not quite so delightful as Rose,&mdash;</span><br />
Not wholly so charming as Dora,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should appear, is it wrong to suppose,&mdash;</span><br />
As the claims of the others are equal,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And flight&mdash;in the main&mdash;is the best,&mdash;</span><br />
That I might ... But no matter,&mdash;the sequel<br />

<h3>NOTHING TO WEAR</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Miss Flora McFlimsey, of Madison Square,<br />
Has made three separate journeys to Paris;<br />
And her father assures me, each time she was there,<br />
That she and her friend Mrs. Harris<br />
(Not the lady whose name is so famous in history,<br />
But plain Mrs. H., without romance or mystery)<br />
Spent six consecutive weeks without stopping,<br />
In one continuous round of shopping;&mdash;<br />
Shopping alone, and shopping together,<br />
At all hours of the day, and in all sorts of weather:<br />
For all manner of things that a woman can put<br />
On the crown of her head or the sole of her foot,<br />
Or wrap round her shoulders, or fit round her waist,<br />
Or that can be sewed on, or pinned on, or laced,<br />
Or tied on with a string, or stitched on with a bow,<br />
In front or behind, above or below;<br />
For bonnets, mantillas, capes, collars, and shawls;<br />
Dresses for breakfasts, and dinners, and balls;<br />
Dresses to sit in, and stand in, and walk in,<br />
Dresses to dance in, and flirt in, and talk in;<br />
Dresses in which to do nothing at all;<br />
Dresses for winter, spring, summer, and fall,&mdash;<br />
All of them different in color and pattern,<br />
Silk, muslin, and lace, crape, velvet, and satin,<br />
Brocade, and broadcloth, and other material<br />
Quite as expensive and much more ethereal:<br />
In short, for all things that could ever be thought of,<br />
Or milliner, modiste, or tradesman be bought of,<br />
From ten-thousand-francs robes to twenty-sous frills;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In all quarters of Paris, and to every store:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While McFlimsey in vain stormed, scolded, and swore.</span><br />
They footed the streets, and he footed the bills.<br />
<br />
The last trip, their goods shipped by the steamer <i>Argo</i><br />
Formed, McFlimsey declares, the bulk of her cargo,<br />
Not to mention a quantity kept from the rest,<br />
Sufficient to fill the largest-sized chest,<br />
Which did not appear on the ship's manifest,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>

But for which the ladies themselves manifested<br />
Such particular interest that they invested<br />
Their own proper persons in layers and rows<br />
Of muslins, embroideries, worked underclothes,<br />
Gloves, handkerchiefs, scarfs, and such trifles as those;<br />
Then, wrapped in great shawls, like Circassian beauties,<br />
Gave <i>good-by</i> to the ship, and <i>go-by</i> to the duties.<br />
Her relations at home all marvelled, no doubt,<br />
Miss Flora had grown so enormously stout<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For an actual belle and a possible bride;</span><br />
But the miracle ceased when she turned inside out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the truth came to light, and the dry-goods beside,</span><br />
Which, in spite of collector and custom-house sentry,<br />
Had entered the port without any entry.<br />
And yet, though scarce three months have passed since the day<br />
The merchandise went, on twelve carts, up Broadway,<br />
This same Miss McFlimsey, of Madison Square,<br />
The last time we met, was in utter despair,<br />
Because she had nothing whatever to wear!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Nothing to wear</span>! Now, as this is a true ditty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I do not assert&mdash;this you know is between us&mdash;</span><br />
That she's in a state of absolute nudity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like Powers's Greek Slave, or the Medici Venus;</span><br />
But I do mean to say I have heard her declare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When at the same moment she had on a dress</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which cost five hundred dollars, and not a cent less,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And jewelry worth ten times more, I should guess,</span><br />
That she had not a thing in the wide world to wear!<br />
I should mention just here, that out of Miss Flora's<br />
Two hundred and fifty or sixty adorers,<br />
I had just been selected as he who should throw all<br />
The rest in the shade, by the gracious bestowal<br />
On myself, after twenty or thirty rejections<br />
Of those fossil remains which she called her "affections,"<br />
And that rather decayed but well-known work of art,<br />
Which Miss Flora persisted in styling "her heart."<br />
So we were engaged. Our troth had been plighted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not by moonbeam or starbeam, by fountain or grove;</span><br />
But in a front parlor, most brilliantly lighted,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the gas-fixtures we whispered our love&mdash;</span><br />
Without any romance, or raptures, or sighs,<br />
Without any tears in Miss Flora's blue eyes,<br />
Or blushes, or transports, or such silly actions;<br />
It was one of the quietest business transactions,<br />
With a very small sprinkling of sentiment, if any,<br />
And a very large diamond imported by Tiffany.<br />
On her virginal lips while I printed a kiss,<br />
She exclaimed, as a sort of parenthesis,<br />
And by way of putting me quite at my ease,<br />
"You know, I'm to polka as much as I please,<br />
And flirt when I like,&mdash;now stop,&mdash;don't you speak,&mdash;<br />
And you must not come here more than twice in the week,<br />
Or talk to me either at party or ball;<br />
But always be ready to come when I call:<br />
So don't prose to me about duty and stuff,&mdash;<br />
If we don't break this off, there will be time enough<br />
For that sort of thing; but the bargain must be,<br />
That as long as I choose I am perfectly free:<br />
For this is a sort of engagement, you see,<br />
Which is binding on you, but not binding on me."<br />
<br />
Well, having thus wooed Miss McFlimsey, and gained her,<br />
With the silks, crinolines, and hoops that contained her,<br />
I had, as I thought, a contingent remainder<br />
At least in the property, and the best right<br />
To appear as its escort by day and by night;<br />
And it being the week of the Stuckups' grand ball,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their cards had been out for a fortnight or so,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And set all the Avenue on the tiptoe,&mdash;</span><br />
I considered it only my duty to call<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And see if Miss Flora intended to go.</span><br />
I found her&mdash;as ladies are apt to be found<br />
When the time intervening between the first sound<br />
Of the bell and the visitor's entry is shorter<br />
Than usual&mdash;I found&mdash;I won't say I caught&mdash;her<br />
Intent on the pier-glass, undoubtedly meaning<br />
To see if perhaps it didn't need cleaning.<br />
She turned as I entered&mdash;"Why, Harry, you sinner,<br />
I thought that you went to the Flashers' to dinner!"<br />
"So I did," I replied; "but the dinner is swallowed,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And digested, I trust; for 'tis now nine or more:</span><br />
So being relieved from that duty, I followed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Inclination, which led me, you see, to your door.</span><br />
And now will your Ladyship so condescend<br />
As just to inform me if you intend<br />
Your beauty and graces and presence to lend<br />
(All of which, when I own, I hope no one will borrow)<br />
To the Stuckups, whose party, you know, is to-morrow?"<br />
The fair Flora looked up with a pitiful air,<br />
And answered quite promptly, "Why, Harry, <i>mon cher</i>,<br />
I should like above all things to go with you there;<br />
But really and truly&mdash;I've nothing to wear."<br />
<br />
"Nothing to wear? Go just as you are:<br />
Wear the dress you have on, and you'll be by far,<br />
I engage, the most bright and particular star<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the Stuckup horizon&mdash;" I stopped, for her eye,</span><br />
Notwithstanding this delicate onset of flattery,<br />
Opened on me at once a most terrible battery<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of scorn and amazement. She made no reply,</span><br />
But gave a slight turn to the end of her nose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(That pure Grecian feature), as much as to say,</span><br />
"How absurd that any sane man should suppose<br />
That a lady would go to a ball in the clothes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No matter how fine, that she wears every day!"</span><br />
So I ventured again&mdash;"Wear your crimson brocade."<br />
(Second turn-up of nose)&mdash;"That's too dark by a shade."&mdash;<br />
"Your blue silk&mdash;" "That's too heavy."&mdash;"Your pink&mdash;" "That's too light."&mdash;<br />
"Wear tulle over satin." "I can't endure white."&mdash;<br />
"Your rose-colored, then, the best of the batch&mdash;"<br />
"I haven't a thread of point lace to match."&mdash;<br />
"Your brown moire-antique&mdash;" "Yes, and look like a Quaker."&mdash;<br />
"The pearl-colored&mdash;" "I would, but that plaguy dressmaker<br />
Has had it a week."&mdash;"Then that exquisite lilac,<br />
In which you would melt the heart of a Shylock."<br />
(Here the nose took again the same elevation)&mdash;<br />
"I wouldn't wear that for the whole of creation."&mdash;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Why not? It's my fancy, there's nothing could strike it</span><br />
As more <i>comme il faut</i>"&mdash;"Yes, but, dear me, that lean<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sophronia Stuckup has got one just like it,</span><br />
And I won't appear dressed like a chit of sixteen."&mdash;<br />
"Then that splendid purple, that sweet mazarine,<br />
That superb <i>point d'aiguille</i>, that imperial green,<br />
That zephyr-like tarlatan, that rich grenadine&mdash;"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Not one of all which is fit to be seen,"</span><br />
Said the lady, becoming excited and flushed.<br />
"Then wear," I exclaimed, in a tone which quite crushed<br />
Opposition, "that gorgeous toilette which you sported<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Paris last spring, at the grand presentation,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When you quite turned the head of the head of the nation;</span><br />
And by all the grand court were so very much courted."<br />
The end of the nose was portentously tipped up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And both the bright eyes shot forth indignation,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As she burst upon me with the fierce exclamation,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I have worn it three times at the least calculation,</span><br />
And that and most of my dresses are ripped up!"<br />
Here I <i>ripped out</i> something, perhaps rather rash&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quite innocent, though; but to use an expression</span><br />
More striking than classic, it "settled my hash,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And proved very soon the last act of our session.</span><br />
"Fiddlesticks, is it, sir? I wonder the ceiling<br />
Doesn't fall down and crush you!&mdash;oh, you men have no feeling.<br />
You selfish, unnatural, illiberal creatures,<br />
Who set yourselves up as patterns and preachers,<br />
Your silly pretence&mdash;why, what a mere guess it is!<br />
Pray, what do you know of a woman's necessities?<br />
I have told you and shown you I've nothing to wear,<br />
And it's perfectly plain you not only don't care,<br />
But you do not believe me" (here the nose went still higher):<br />
"I suppose if you dared you would call me a liar.<br />
Our engagement is ended, sir&mdash;yes, on the spot;<br />
You're a brute, and a monster, and&mdash;I don't know what."<br />
I mildly suggested the words Hottentot,<br />
Pickpocket, and cannibal, Tartar, and thief,<br />
As gentle expletives which might give relief:<br />
But this only proved as a spark to the powder,<br />
And the storm I had raised came faster and louder;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>

It blew, and it rained, thundered, lightened, and hailed<br />
Interjections, verbs, pronouns, till language quite failed<br />
To express the abusive, and then its arrears<br />
Were brought up all at once by a torrent of tears;<br />
And my last faint, despairing attempt at an obs-<br />
Ervation was lost in a tempest of sobs.<br />
<br />
Well, I felt for the lady, and felt for my hat too,<br />
Improvised on the crown of the latter a tattoo,<br />
In lieu of expressing the feelings which lay<br />
Quite too deep for words, as Wordsworth would say:<br />
Then, without going through the form of a bow,<br />
Found myself in the entry,&mdash;I hardly knew how,&mdash;<br />
On doorstep and sidewalk, past lamp-post and square,<br />
At home and up-stairs, in my own easy-chair;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poked my feet into slippers, my fire into blaze,</span><br />
And said to myself, as I lit my cigar,&mdash;<br />
Supposing a man had the wealth of the Czar<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the Russias to boot, for the rest of his days,</span><br />
On the whole do you think he would have much time to spare<br />
If he married a woman with nothing to wear?<br />

<h3>MRS. SMITH</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Last year I trod these fields with Di,<br />
Fields fresh with clover and with rye;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They now seem arid!</span><br />
Then Di was fair and single; how<br />
Unfair it seems on me, for now<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Di's fair&mdash;and married!</span><br />
<br />
A blissful swain&mdash;I scorn'd the song<br />
Which says that though young Love is strong,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Fates are stronger;</span><br />
Breezes then blew a boon to men,<br />
The buttercups were bright, and then<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This grass was longer.</span><br />
<br />
That day I saw and much esteem'd<br />
Di's ankles, which the clover seem'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Inclined to smother;</span><br />
It twitch'd, and soon untied (for fun)<br />
The ribbon of her shoes, first one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then the other.</span><br />
<br />
I'm told that virgins augur some<br />
Misfortune if their shoe-strings come<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To grief on Friday:</span><br />
And so did Di, and then her pride<br />
Decreed that shoe-strings so untied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are "so untidy!"</span><br />
<br />
Of course I knelt; with fingers deft<br />
I tied the right, and then the left;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says Di, "The stubble</span><br />
Is very stupid!&mdash;as I live,<br />
I'm quite ashamed!&mdash;I'm shock'd to give<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You so much trouble!"</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>

<br />
For answer I was fain to sink<br />
To what we all would say and think<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were Beauty present:</span><br />
"Don't mention such a simple act&mdash;<br />
A trouble? not the least! in fact<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It's rather pleasant!"</span><br />
<br />
I trust that Love will never tease<br />
Poor little Di, or prove that he's<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A graceless rover.</span><br />
She's happy now as <i>Mrs. Smith</i>&mdash;<br />
And less polite when walking with<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her chosen lover!</span><br />
<br />
Heigh-ho! Although no moral clings<br />
To Di's blue eyes, and sandal strings,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We've had our quarrels!&mdash;</span><br />
I think that Smith is thought an ass;<br />
I know that when they walk in grass<br />

Her limbs were tied in a double bow-knot<br />

No curse there sprang to my pallid lips,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor did I reproach her then;</span><br />
I calmly untied my bonny bride<br />

For the sweet, sweet sake of the Human Snake<br />

But she skipped in the end with an old, old friend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An eminent bearded lady.</span><br />
But, oh, at night, when my slumber's light,<br />

And all the lands both far and near,<br />

Yet Nora, ere its bloom be gone,<br />
May blithely wed the Earlie's son."<br />

"The swan," she said, "the lake's clear breast<br />
May barter for the eagle's nest;<br />
The Awe's fierce stream may backward turn,<br />
Ben-Cruaichan fall, and crush Kilchurn;<br />
Our kilted clans, when blood is high,<br />
Before their foes may turn and fly;<br />
But I, were all these marvels done,<br />
Would never wed the Earlie's son."<br />
<br />
Still in the water-lily's shade<br />
Her wonted nest the wild swan made;<br />
Ben-Cruaichan stands as fast as ever,<br />
Still downward foams the Awe's fierce river;<br />
To shun the clash of foeman's steel,<br />
No Highland brogue has turn'd the heel;<br />
But Nora's heart is lost and won,<br />
&mdash;She's wedded to the Earlie's son!<br />

<h3>THE LOST PLEIAD</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas a pretty little maiden</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In a garden gray and old,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the apple trees were laden</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With the magic fruit of gold;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But she strayed beyond the portal</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of the garden of the Sun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she flirted with a mortal,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which she oughtn't to have done!</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>

<br />
For a giant was her father and a goddess was her mother,<br />
She was Merope or Sterope&mdash;the one or else the other;<br />
And the man was not the equal, though presentable and rich,<br />
Of Merope or Sterope&mdash;I don't remember which!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now the giant's daughters seven,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She among them, if you please,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were translated to the heaven</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As the starry Pleiades!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But amid their constellation</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">One alone was always dark,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For she shrank from observation</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or censorious remark.</span><br />
<br />
She had yielded to a mortal when he came to flirt and flatter.<br />
She was Merope or Sterope&mdash;the former or the latter;<br />
So the planets all ignored her, and the comets wouldn't call<br />
On Merope or Sterope&mdash;I am not sure at all!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the Dog-star, brightly shining</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the hottest of July,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Saw the pretty Pleiad pining</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the shadow of the sky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he courted her and kissed her</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till she kindled into light;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Pleiads' erring sister</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was the lady of the night!</span><br />
<br />
So her former indiscretion as a fault was never reckoned,<br />
To Merope or Sterope&mdash;the first or else the second,<br />
And you'll never see so rigidly respectable a dame<br />
As Merope or Sterope&mdash;I can't recall her name!<br />

They've got a chorister and choir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ag'in' <i>my</i> voice and vote;</span><br />
For it was never <i>my</i> desire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To praise the Lord by note.</span><br />
<br />
I've been a sister good an' true<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For five-an'-thirty year;</span><br />
I've done what seemed my part to do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' prayed my duty clear;</span><br />
I've sung the hymns both slow and quick,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just as the preacher read,</span><br />
And twice, when Deacon Tubbs was sick,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I took the fork an' led;</span><br />
And now, their bold, new-fangled ways<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is comin' all about;</span><br />
And I, right in my latter days,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Am fairly crowded out!</span><br />
<br />
To-day the preacher, good old dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With tears all in his eyes,</span><br />
Read, "I can read my title clear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To mansions in the skies."</span><br />
I al'ays liked that blessed hymn&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I s'pose I al'ays will&mdash;</span><br />
It somehow gratifies <i>my</i> whim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In good old Ortonville;</span><br />
But when that choir got up to sing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I couldn't catch a word;</span><br />
They sung the most dog-gondest thing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A body ever heard!</span><br />
<br />
Some worldly chaps was standin' near;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' when I see them grin,</span><br />
I bid farewell to every fear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And boldly waded in.</span><br />
I thought I'd chase their tune along,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' tried with all my might;</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>

But though my voice was good an' strong,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I couldn't steer it right.</span><br />
When they was high, then I was low,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' also contrawise;</span><br />
An' I too fast, or they too slow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To "mansions in the skies."</span><br />
<br />
An' after every verse, you know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They play a little tune;</span><br />
I didn't understand, and so<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I started in too soon.</span><br />
I pitched it pretty middlin' high,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I fetched a lusty tone,</span><br />
But oh, alas! I found that I<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was singin' there alone!</span><br />
They laughed a little, I am told;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I had done my best;</span><br />
And not a wave of trouble rolled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Across my peaceful breast.</span><br />
<br />
And Sister Brown&mdash;I could but look&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She sits right front of me;</span><br />
She never was no singin'-book,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' never went to be;</span><br />
But then she al'ays tried to do<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The best she could, she said;</span><br />
She understood the time right through,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' kep' it with her head;</span><br />
But when she tried this mornin', oh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I had to laugh, or cough!</span><br />
It kep' her head a-bobbin' so,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It e'en a'most came off.</span><br />
<br />
An' Deacon Tubbs&mdash;he all broke 'down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As one might well suppose;</span><br />
He took one look at Sister Brown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And meekly scratched his nose.</span><br />
He looked his hymn-book through and through,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And laid it on the seat,</span><br />
And then a pensive sigh he drew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And looked completely beat.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>

And when they took another bout,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He didn't even rise;</span><br />
But drawed his red bandanner out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' wiped his weepin' eyes.</span><br />
<br />
I've been a sister, good an' true,<br />

But Death will stop my voice, I know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he is on my track;</span><br />
And some day I to church will go,<br />

And when the folks gets up to sing&mdash;<br />

With just room enough for two pig-pens between.<br />
The widow was young and the widow was fair,<br />
With the brightest of eyes and the brownest of hair,<br />
And it frequently chanced, when she came in the morn,<br />
With the swill for her pig, Larrie came with the corn,<br />

"If ye fale in your heart we are mane to the pigs,<br />

Och! it made me heart ache when I paped through the cracks<br />

She sent tins of red tomato<br />
To the tribes beyond the Equator,<br />

The poor helpless, homeless thing<br />

<h3>ANY ONE WILL DO</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
A maiden once, of certain age,<br />
To catch a husband did engage;<br />
But, having passed the prime of life<br />
In striving to become a wife<br />
Without success, she thought it time<br />
To mend the follies of her prime.<br />
<br />
Departing from the usual course<br />
Of paint and such like for resource,<br />
With all her might this ancient maid<br />
Beneath an oak-tree knelt and prayed;<br />
Unconscious that a grave old owl<br />
Was perched above&mdash;the mousing fowl!<br />
<br />
"Oh, give! a husband give!" she cried,<br />
"While yet I may become a bride;<br />
Soon will my day of grace be o'er,<br />
And then, like many maids before,<br />
I'll die without an early Jove,<br />
And none to meet me there above!<br />
<br />
"Oh, 'tis a fate too hard to bear!<br />
Then answer this my humble prayer,<br />
And oh, a husband give to me!"<br />
Just then the owl from out the tree,<br />
In deep bass tones cried, "Who&mdash;who&mdash;who!"<br />
"Who, Lord? And dost Thou ask me who?<br />
Why, any one, good Lord, will do."<br />

<h3>THE BELLE OF THE BALL</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Years&mdash;years ago,&mdash;ere yet my dreams<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had been of being wise and witty,&mdash;</span><br />
Ere I had done with writing themes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or yawn'd o'er this infernal Chitty;&mdash;</span><br />
Years, years ago, while all my joy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was in my fowling-piece and filly:</span><br />
In short, while I was yet a boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I fell in love with Laura Lily.</span><br />
<br />
I saw her at the county ball;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There, when the sounds of flute and fiddle</span><br />
Gave signal sweet in that old hall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of hands across and down the middle,</span><br />
Hers was the subtlest spell by far<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all that set young hearts romancing:</span><br />
She was our queen, our rose, our star;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when she danced&mdash;O Heaven, her dancing!</span><br />
<br />
Dark was her hair, her hand was white;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her voice was exquisitely tender,</span><br />
Her eyes were full of liquid light;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I never saw a waist so slender;</span><br />
Her every look, her every smile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shot right and left a score of arrows;</span><br />
I thought 'twas Venus from her isle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wonder'd where she'd left her sparrows.</span><br />
<br />
She talk'd,&mdash;of politics or prayers;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Southey's prose, or Wordsworth's sonnets;</span><br />
Of daggers or of dancing bears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of battles, or the last new bonnets;</span><br />
By candle-light, at twelve o'clock,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To me it matter'd not a tittle,</span><br />
If those bright lips had quoted Locke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I might have thought they murmur'd Little.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg&nbsp;172]</a></span>

<br />
Through sunny May, through sultry June,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I loved her with a love eternal;</span><br />
I spoke her praises to the moon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I wrote them for the <i>Sunday Journal</i>.</span><br />
My mother laugh'd; I soon found out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That ancient ladies have no feeling;</span><br />
My father frown'd; but how should gout<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">See any happiness in kneeling?</span><br />
<br />
She was the daughter of a Dean,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rich, fat, and rather apoplectic;</span><br />
She had one brother, just thirteen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose color was extremely hectic;</span><br />
Her grandmother for many a year<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had fed the parish with her bounty;</span><br />
Her second cousin was a peer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lord lieutenant of the county.</span><br />
<br />
But titles and the three per cents,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And mortgages, and great relations,</span><br />
And India bonds, and tithes and rents,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! what are they to love's sensations?</span><br />
Black eyes, fair forehead, clustering locks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such wealth, such honors, Cupid chooses;</span><br />
He cares as little for the stocks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As Baron Rothschild for the Muses.</span><br />
<br />
She sketch'd; the vale, the wood, the beach,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grew lovelier from her pencil's shading;</span><br />
She botanized; I envied each<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Young blossom in her boudoir fading;</span><br />
She warbled Handel; it was grand&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She made the Catalani jealous;</span><br />
She touch'd the organ; I could stand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For hours and hours to blow the bellows.</span><br />
<br />
She kept an album, too, at home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well fill'd with all an album's glories;</span><br />
Paintings of butterflies, and Rome,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Patterns for trimming, Persian stories;</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>

Soft songs to Julia's cockatoo,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fierce odes to Famine and to Slaughter;</span><br />
And autographs of Prince Leboo,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And recipes for elder water.</span><br />
<br />
And she was flatter'd, worshipp'd, bored;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her steps were watch'd, her dress was noted;</span><br />
Her poodle dog was quite adored,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her sayings were extremely quoted.</span><br />
She laugh'd, and every heart was glad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if the taxes were abolish'd;</span><br />
She frown'd, and every look was sad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if the Opera were demolished.</span><br />
<br />
She smil'd on many just for fun&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I knew that there was nothing in it;</span><br />
I was the first&mdash;the only one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her heart had thought of for a minute;</span><br />
I knew it, for she told me so,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In phrase which was divinely moulded;</span><br />
She wrote a charming hand,&mdash;and oh!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How sweetly all her notes were folded!</span><br />
<br />
Our love was like most other loves&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A little glow, a little shiver;</span><br />
A rosebud and a pair of gloves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And "Fly Not Yet," upon the river;</span><br />
Some jealousy of some one's heir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some hopes of dying broken-hearted,</span><br />
A miniature, a lock of hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The usual vows&mdash;and then we parted.</span><br />
<br />
We parted;&mdash;months and years roll'd by;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We met again four summers after;</span><br />
Our parting was all sob and sigh&mdash;-<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our meeting was all mirth and laughter;</span><br />
For in my heart's most secret cell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There had been many other lodgers;</span><br />
And she was not the ballroom belle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But only&mdash;Mrs. Something Rogers.</span><br />

Poor Jane had scarce become a wife,<br />

<h3>THE CHRONICLE: A BALLAD</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Margarita first possess'd,<br />
If I remember well, my breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Margarita, first of all;</span><br />
But when a while the wanton maid<br />
With my restless heart had play'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Martha took the flying ball.</span><br />
<br />
Martha soon did it resign<br />
To the beauteous Catharine.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beauteous Catharine gave place</span><br />
(Though loth and angry she to part<br />
With the possession of my heart)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Eliza's conquering face.</span><br />
<br />
Eliza till this hour might reign,<br />
Had she not evil counsel ta'en:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fundamental laws she broke,</span><br />
And still new favourites she chose,<br />
Till up in arms my passions rose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cast away her yoke.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>

<br />
Mary then and gentle Anne,<br />
Both to reign at once began,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Alternately they swayed:</span><br />
And sometimes Mary was the fair,<br />
And sometimes Anne the crown did wear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sometimes both I obey'd.</span><br />
<br />
Another Mary then arose,<br />
And did rigorous laws impose;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A mighty tyrant she!</span><br />
Long, alas, should I have been<br />
Under that iron-scepter'd queen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had not Rebecca set me free.</span><br />
<br />
When fair Rebecca set me free,<br />
'Twas then a golden time with me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But soon those pleasures fled;</span><br />
For the gracious princess died<br />
In her youth and beauty's pride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Judith reigned in her stead.</span><br />
<br />
One month, three days, and half an hour,<br />
Judith held the sovereign power,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wondrous beautiful her face;</span><br />
But so weak and small her wit,<br />
That she to govern was unfit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so Susanna took her place.</span><br />
<br />
But when Isabella came,<br />
Arm'd with a resistless flame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And th' artillery of her eye;</span><br />
Whilst she proudly march'd about<br />
Greater conquests to find out:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She beat out Susan by the bye.</span><br />
<br />
But in her place I then obey'd<br />
Black-ey'd Bess, her viceroy maid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To whom ensued a vacancy:</span><br />
Thousand worse passions then possess'd<br />
The interregnum of my breast;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bless me from such an anarchy.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>

<br />
Gentle Henrietta then,<br />
And a third Mary next began;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Joan, and Jane, and Andria:</span><br />
And then a pretty Thomasine,<br />
And then another Catharine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then a long et c&aelig;tera.</span><br />
<br />
But should I now to you relate<br />
The strength and riches of their state,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The powder, patches, and the pins,</span><br />
The ribbons, jewels, and the rings,<br />
The lace, the paint, and warlike things,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That make up all their magazines:</span><br />
<br />
If I should tell the politic arts<br />
To take and keep men's hearts;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The letters, embassies, and spies,</span><br />
The frowns, and smiles, and flatteries,<br />
The quarrels, tears, and perjuries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Numberless, nameless, mysteries!</span><br />
<br />
And all the little lime-twigs laid<br />
By Machiavel, the waiting maid;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I more voluminous should grow</span><br />
(Chiefly if I, like them, should tell<br />
All change of weather that befel)<br />

A soldier and a sailor,<br />
A tinker and a tailor,<br />
Had once a doubtful strife, sir,<br />
To make a maid a wife, sir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose name was Buxom Joan.</span><br />
For now the time was ended,<br />
When she no more intended<br />
To lick her lips at men, sir,<br />
And gnaw the sheets in vain, sir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lie o' nights alone.</span><br />
<br />
The soldier swore like thunder,<br />
He loved her more than plunder;<br />
And showed her many a scar, sir,<br />
That he had brought from far, sir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With fighting for her sake.</span><br />
The tailor thought to please her,<br />
With offering her his measure.<br />
The tinker too with mettle,<br />
Said he could mend her kettle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And stop up every leak.</span><br />
<br />
But while these three were prating,<br />
The sailor slily waiting,<br />
Thought if it came about, sir,<br />
That they should all fall out, sir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He then might play his part.</span><br />
And just e'en as he meant, sir,<br />
To loggerheads they went, sir,<br />
And then he let fly at her<br />
A shot 'twixt wind and water,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That won this fair maid's heart.</span><br />

Of all the girls that are so smart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's none like Pretty Sally;</span><br />
She is the darling of my heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lives in our alley.</span><br />
There's ne'er a lady in the land<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That's half so sweet as Sally;</span><br />
She is the darling of my heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lives in our alley.</span><br />
<br />
Her father he makes cabbage-nets,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And through the streets does cry them;</span><br />
Her mother she sells laces long<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To such as please to buy them:</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In such a girl as Sally;</span><br />
She is the darling of my heart,<br />

<br />
When she is by, I leave my work,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I love her so sincerely;</span><br />
My master comes, like any Turk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bangs me most severely:</span><br />
But let him bang, long as he will,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll bear it all for Sally;</span><br />
She is the darling of my heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lives in our alley.</span><br />
<br />
Of all the days are in the week,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I dearly love but one day,</span><br />
And that's the day that comes betwixt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A Saturday and Monday;</span><br />
For then I'm dressed, all in my best,<br />

She is the darling of my heart,<br />

When Christmas comes about again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, then I shall have money;</span><br />
I'll hoard it up and, box and all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll give it to my honey;</span><br />
Oh, would it were ten thousand pounds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd give it all to Sally;</span><br />
For she's the darling of my heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lives in our alley.</span><br />
<br />
My master, and the neighbors all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Make game of me and Sally,</span><br />
And but for her I'd better be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A slave, and row a galley:</span><br />
But when my seven long years are out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, then I'll marry Sally,</span><br />
And then how happily we'll live&mdash;<br />

It was a millinger most gay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As sat within her shop;</span><br />
A student came along that way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in he straight did pop.</span><br />
Clean shaven he, of massive mould,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He thought his looks was killing her;</span><br />
So lots of stuff to him she sold:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thanks!" says the millinger.</span><br />

He loafed around and seemed to try<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On all things to converse;</span><br />
The millinger did mind her eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But also mound his purse.</span><br />
He tried, then, with his flattering tongue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With nonsense to be filling her;</span><br />
But she was sharp, though she was young:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thanks," said the millinger.</span><br />

Fairly the fair one's fare he paid:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thanks!" said the millinger.</span><br />
<br />
When we arrived in Bowdoin Square,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A female to them ran;</span><br />
Then says that millinger so fair:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O, thank you, Mary Ann!</span><br />
She's going with us, she is," says she,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"She only is fulfilling her</span><br />
Duty in looking after me:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thanks!" said that millinger.</span><br />
<br />
"Why," says that student chap to her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I've but two seats to hand."</span><br />
"Too bad," replied that millinger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Then you will have to stand."</span><br />
"I won't stand this," says he, "I own<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The joke which you've been drilling her;</span><br />
Here, take the seats and go alone!"<br />

<br />
She said that the daisies blushed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the kiss that I had ta'en;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Now, laddie!</span><br />
I winna stay under your plaidie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If I gang hame in the rain!"</span><br />
<br />
But, on an after Sunday,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When cloud there was not ane,</span><br />
This selfsame winsome lassie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(We chanced to meet in the lane),</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Said, "Laddie,</span><br />
Why dinna ye wear your plaidie?<br />

It was a Moorish maiden was sitting by a well,<br />
And what the maiden thought of I cannot, cannot tell.<br />
When by there rode a valiant knight from the town of Oviedo&mdash;<br />
Alphonso Guzman was he hight, the Count of Desparedo.<br />
<br />
"Oh, maiden, Moorish maiden! why sitt'st thou by the spring?<br />
Say, dost thou seek a lover, or any other thing?<br />
Why gazest thou upon me, with eyes so large and wide,<br />
And wherefore doth the pitcher lie broken by thy side?"<br />

"I do not seek a lover, thou Christian knight so gay,<br />
Because an article like that hath never come my way;<br />
And why I gaze upon you, I cannot, cannot tell,<br />
Except that in your iron hose you look uncommon swell.<br />
<br />
"My pitcher it is broken, and this the reason is,&mdash;<br />
A shepherd came behind me, and tried to snatch a kiss;<br />
I would not stand his nonsense, so ne'er a word I spoke,<br />
But scored him on the costard, and so the jug was broke.<br />
<br />
"My uncle, the Alcayd&egrave;, he waits for me at home,<br />
And will not take his tumbler until Zorayda come.<br />
I cannot bring him water&mdash;the pitcher is in pieces&mdash;<br />
And so I'm sure to catch it, 'cos he wallops all his nieces."<br />
<br />
"Oh, maiden, Moorish maiden! wilt thou be ruled by me!<br />
So wipe thine eyes and rosy lips, and give me kisses three;<br />
And I'll give thee my helmet, thou kind and courteous lady,<br />
To carry home the water to thy uncle, the Alcayd&egrave;."<br />
<br />
He lighted down from off his steed&mdash;he tied him to a tree&mdash;<br />
He bowed him to the maiden, and took his kisses three:<br />
"To wrong thee, sweet Zorayda, I swear would be a sin!"<br />
He knelt him at the fountain, and he dipped his helmet in.<br />
<br />
Up rose the Moorish maiden&mdash;behind the knight she steals,<br />
And caught Alphonso Guzman up tightly by the heels;<br />
She tipped him in, and held him down beneath the bubbling water,&mdash;<br />
"Now, take thou that for venturing to kiss Al Hamet's daughter!"<br />
<br />
A Christian maid is weeping in the town of Oviedo;<br />
She waits the coming of her love, the Count of Desparedo.<br />
I pray you all in charity, that you will never tell,<br />
How he met the Moorish maiden beside the lonely well.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 5em;">But she did&mdash;in the usual way.</span><br />
<br />
Then the stars came out above them, and she gave a little sigh,<br />

"We must say good-by," she whispered, by the alders old and gray,<br />

And day by day beside the stream they wandered to and fro,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I ran to meet my love;</span><br />
When I press'd her hand so tiny<br />

Was I very deeply smitten?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, I loved like <i>anything</i>!</span><br />

<br />
Would she listen to my offer,<br />

A sincere and ready proffer<br />

His eyes were blue and hers were brown,<br />

I love thee, Mary, and thou lovest me&mdash;<br />

I am Potassium to thine Oxygen.<br />

Is, after all, but metaphysical.<br />

<h3>CATEGORICAL COURTSHIP</h3>

<p>
I sat one night beside a blue-eyed girl&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fire was out, and so, too, was her mother;</span><br />
A feeble flame around the lamp did curl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Making faint shadows, blending in each other:</span><br />
'Twas nearly twelve o'clock, too, in November;<br />
She had a shawl on, also, I remember.<br />
<br />
Well, I had been to see her every night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For thirteen days, and had a sneaking notion</span><br />
To pop the question, thinking all was right,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And once or twice had make an awkward motion</span><br />

<br />
I thought this chance too good now to be lost;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I hitched my chair up pretty close beside her,</span><br />
Drew a long breath, and then my legs I cross'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bent over, sighed, and for five minutes eyed her:</span><br />
She looked as if she knew what next was coming,<br />
And with her feet upon the floor was drumming.<br />
<br />
I didn't know how to begin, or where&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I couldn't speak&mdash;the words were always choking;</span><br />
I scarce could move&mdash;I seem'd tied to the chair&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I hardly breathed&mdash;'twas awfully provoking!</span><br />
The perspiration from each pore came oozing,<br />
My heart, and brain, and limbs their power seem'd losing.<br />
<br />
At length I saw a brindle tabby cat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Walk purring up, inviting me to pat her;</span><br />
An idea came, electric-like at that&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My doubts, like summer clouds, began to scatter,</span><br />
I seized on tabby, though a scratch she gave me,<br />
And said, "Come, Puss, ask Mary if she'll have me."<br />
<br />
'Twas done at once&mdash;the murder now was out;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The thing was all explain'd in half a minute.</span><br />
She blush'd, and, turning pussy-cat about,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said, "Pussy, tell him 'yes'"; her foot was in it!</span><br />
The cat had thus saved me my category,<br />

While a throne we made on a rough stone wall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the king and the queen were we;</span><br />
And I sat with my arm about Kitty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she with her arm about me.</span><br />

The water was mad in the moonlight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the sand like gold where it shone,</span><br />
And our hearts kept time to its music,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As we sat in the splendour alone.</span><br />
And Kitty's dear eyes twinkled brightly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Kitty's brown hair blew so free,</span><br />
While I sat with my arm about Kitty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she with her arm about me.</span><br />
<br />
Last night we drove in our carriage,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the wall at the top of the hill;</span><br />
And though we're forty years older,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We're children and sweethearts still.</span><br />
And we talked again of that moonlight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That danced so mad on the sea,</span><br />

And Kitty's waist measure is forty,<br />

A story of a cock and bull,<br />
Must have a most uncommon skull.<br />
It chanced, then, on a winter's day,<br />
But warm, and bright, and calm as May,<br />
The birds, conceiving a design<br />
To forestall sweet St. Valentine,<br />
In many an orchard, copse, and grove,<br />
Assembled on affairs of love,<br />
And, with much twitter and much chatter,<br />
Began to agitate the matter.<br />
At length a bullfinch, who could boast<br />
More years and wisdom than the most,<br />
Entreated, opening wide his beak,<br />
A moment's liberty to speak;<br />
And, silence publicly enjoin'd,<br />
Deliver'd briefly thus his mind:<br />
"My friends, be cautious how ye treat<br />
The subject upon which we meet;<br />
I fear we shall have winter yet."<br />
A finch, whose tongue knew no control,<br />
With golden wing and satin poll,<br />
A last year's bird, who ne'er had tried<br />
What marriage means, thus pert replied:<br />

Dick heard, and tweedling, ogling, bridling,<br />
Turned short 'round, strutting, and sidling,<br />
Attested, glad, his approbation<br />
Of an immediate conjugation.<br />
Their sentiments, so well express'd,<br />
Influenced mightily the rest;<br />
All pair'd, and each pair built a nest.<br />
But, though the birds were thus in haste,<br />
The leaves came on not quite so fast,<br />
And destiny, that sometimes bears<br />
An aspect stern on man's affairs,<br />
Not altogether smiled on theirs.<br />
The wind, of late breathed gently forth,<br />
Now shifted east, and east by north;<br />
Bare trees and shrubs but ill, you know,<br />
Could shelter them from rain or snow.<br />
Stepping into their nests, they paddled,<br />
Themselves were chill'd, their eggs were addled.<br />
Soon every father bird and mother<br />
Grew quarrelsome, and peck'd each other,<br />
Parted without the least regret,<br />
Except that they had ever met,<br />
And learn'd in future to be wiser<br />
Than to neglect a good adviser.<br />

He'd more idjucation, had Flannigan;<br />
An' it wore'm clane an' completely out<br />
To tell what Finnigin writ about<br />

An' some kyars went off as they made the swerve.<br />
"There's nobody hurted," sez Finnigin,<br />
"But repoorts must be made to Flannigan."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' he winked at McGorrigan,</span><br />

<h3>POST-IMPRESSIONISM</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
I cannot tell you how I love<br />
The canvases of Mr. Dove,<br />
Which Saturday I went to see<br />
In Mr. Thurber's gallery.<br />
<br />
At first you fancy they are built<br />
As patterns for a crazy quilt,<br />
But soon you see that they express<br />
An ambient simultaneousness.<br />
<br />
This thing which you would almost bet<br />
Portrays a Spanish omelette,<br />
Depicts instead, with wondrous skill,<br />
A horse and cart upon a hill.<br />
<br />
Now, Mr. Dove has too much art<br />
To show the horse or show the cart;<br />
Instead, he paints the <i>creak</i> and <i>strain</i>,<br />
Get it? No pike is half as plain.<br />
<br />
This thing which would appear to show<br />
A fancy vest scenario,<br />
Is really quite another thing,<br />
A flock of pigeons on the wing.<br />
<br />
But Mr. Dove is much too keen<br />
To let a single bird be seen;<br />
To show the pigeons would not do<br />
And so he simply paints the <i>coo</i>.<br />
<br />
It's all as simple as can be;<br />
He paints the things you cannot see,<br />
Just as composers please the ear<br />
With "programme" things you cannot hear.<br />
<br />
Dove is the cleverest of chaps;<br />
And, gazing at his rhythmic maps,<br />
I wondered (and I'm wondering yet)<br />
Whether he did them on a bet.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What more have eyes to do?</span><br />
<br />
Thy mouth&mdash;that fissure in thy face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By something like a chin,&mdash;</span><br />
May be a very useful place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To put thy victual in.</span><br />
<br />
I know thou hast a wife at home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I know thou hast a child,</span><br />
By that subdued, domestic smile<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Upon thy features mild.</span><br />
<br />
That wife sits fearless by thy side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That cherub on thy knee;</span><br />
They do not shudder at thy looks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They do not shrink from thee.</span><br />
<br />
Above thy mantel is a hook,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A portrait once was there;</span><br />

She wept,&mdash;and breathed a trembling prayer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To meet it safe again.</span><br />
<br />
It was a bitter sight to see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That picture torn away;</span><br />
It was a solemn thought to think<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What all her friends would say!</span><br />
<br />
And often in her calmer hours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And in her happy dreams,</span><br />
Upon its long-deserted hook<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The absent portrait seems.</span><br />
<br />
Thy wretched infant turns his head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In melancholy wise,</span><br />
And looks to meet the placid stare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of those unbending eyes.</span><br />
<br />
I never saw thee, lovely one,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Perchance I never may;</span><br />
It is not often that we cross<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Such people in our way;</span><br />
<br />
But if we meet in distant years,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or on some foreign shore,</span><br />
Sure I can take my Bible oath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I've seen that face before.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I was right and you were wrong.</span><br />
<br />
No mad diversity of creed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has ever sundered me from thee;</span><br />
For I permit you evermore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To borrow your ideas of me.</span><br />
And thus it is, through weal or woe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our love forevermore endures;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus in peace we toil along,</span><br />
For I am willing to admit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I am right and you are wrong.</span><br />
<br />
And when our matrimonial skiff<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Strikes snags in love's meandering stream,</span><br />
I lift our shallop from the rocks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And float as in a placid dream.</span><br />
And well I know our marriage bliss<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While life shall last will never cease;</span><br />
For I shall always let thee do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In generous love, just what I please.</span><br />
Peace comes, and discord flies away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Love's bright day follows hatred's night;</span><br />
For I am ready to admit<br />

If all the harm that women have done<br />

The fable which I now present,<br />
Occurred to me by accident:<br />
And whether bad or excellent,<br />
Is merely so by accident.<br />

A stupid ass this morning went<br />
Into a field by accident:<br />
And cropped his food, and was content,<br />
Until he spied by accident<br />
A flute, which some oblivious gent<br />
Had left behind by accident;<br />
When, sniffling it with eager scent,<br />
He breathed on it by accident,<br />
And made the hollow instrument<br />
Emit a sound by accident.<br />

<p>
It was a summer's evening;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Old Casper's work was done,</span><br />
And he before his cottage-door<br />

His little grandchild Wilhelmine.<br />

<br />
Old Casper took it from the boy,<br />

And then the old man shook his head,<br />

<h3>THE THREE BLACK CROWS</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Two honest tradesmen meeting in the Strand,<br />
One took the other briskly by the hand;<br />
"Hark-ye," said he, "'tis an odd story, this,<br />
About the crows!" "I don't know what it is,"<br />
Replied his friend. "No! I'm surprised at that;<br />
Where I came from it is the common chat;<br />
But you shall hear&mdash;an odd affair indeed!<br />
And that it happened, they are all agreed.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg&nbsp;255]</a></span>

Not to detain you from a thing so strange,<br />
A gentleman, that lives not far from 'Change,<br />
This week, in short, as all the alley knows,<br />
Taking a puke, has thrown up three black crows."<br />
"Impossible!" "Nay, but it's really true;<br />
I have it from good hands, and so may you."<br />
"From whose, I pray?" So, having named the man,<br />
Straight to inquire his curious comrade ran.<br />
"Sir, did you tell"&mdash;relating the affair.<br />
"Yes, sir, I did; and, if it's worth your care,<br />
Ask Mr. Such-a-one, he told it me.<br />
But, by the bye, 'twas two black crows&mdash;not three."<br />
Resolved to trace so wondrous an event,<br />
Whip, to the third, the virtuoso went;<br />
"Sir"&mdash;and so forth. "Why, yes; the thing is fact,<br />
Though, in regard to number, not exact;<br />
It was not two black crows&mdash;'twas only one;<br />
The truth of that you may depend upon;<br />
The gentleman himself told me the case."<br />
"Where may I find him?" "Why, in such a place."<br />
Away goes he, and, having found him out,<br />
"Sir, be so good as to resolve a doubt."<br />
Then to his last informant he referred,<br />
And begged to know if true what he had heard.<br />
"Did you, sir, throw up a black crow?" "Not I."<br />
"Bless me! how people propagate a lie!<br />
Black crows have been thrown up, three, two, and one;<br />
And here, I find, all comes, at last, to none.<br />
Did you say nothing of a crow at all?"<br />
"Crow&mdash;crow&mdash;perhaps I might, now I recall<br />
The matter over." "And pray, sir, what was't?"<br />
"Why, I was horrid sick, and, at the last,<br />
I did throw up, and told my neighbor so,<br />
Something that was&mdash;as black, sir, as a crow."<br />

<h3>ETIQUETTE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
The <i>Ballyshannon</i> foundered off the coast of Cariboo,<br />
And down in fathoms many went the captain and the crew;<br />
Down went the owners&mdash;greedy men whom hope of gain allured:<br />
Oh, dry the starting tear, for they were heavily insured.<br />
<br />
Besides the captain and the mate, the owners and the crew,<br />
The passengers were also drowned excepting only two:<br />
Young Peter Gray, who tasted teas for Baker, Croop, and Co.,<br />
And Somers, who from Eastern shores imported indigo.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg&nbsp;257]</a></span>

<br />
These passengers, by reason of their clinging to a mast,<br />
Upon a desert island were eventually cast.<br />
They hunted for their meals, as Alexander Selkirk used,<br />
But they couldn't chat together&mdash;they had not been introduced.<br />
<br />
For Peter Gray, and Somers, too, though certainly in trade,<br />
Were properly particular about the friends they made;<br />
And somehow thus they settled it, without a word of mouth,<br />
That Gray should take the northern half, while Somers took the south.<br />
<br />
On Peter's portion oysters grew&mdash;a delicacy rare,<br />
But oysters were a delicacy Peter couldn't bear.<br />
On Somer's side was turtle, on the shingle lying thick,<br />
Which Somers couldn't eat, because it always made him sick.<br />
<br />
Gray gnashed his teeth with envy as he saw a mighty store<br />
Of turtle unmolested on his fellow-creature's shore.<br />
The oysters at his feet aside impatiently he shoved,<br />
For turtle and his mother were the only things he loved.<br />
<br />
And Somers sighed in sorrow as he settled in the south,<br />
For the thought of Peter's oysters brought the water to his mouth.<br />
He longed to lay him down upon the shelly bed, and stuff:<br />
He had often eaten oysters, but had never had enough.<br />
<br />
How they wished an introduction to each other they had had<br />
When on board the <i>Ballyshannon</i>! And it drove them nearly mad<br />
To think how very friendly with each other they might get,<br />
If it wasn't for the arbitrary rule of etiquette!<br />
<br />
One day, when out a-hunting for the <i>mus ridiculus</i>,<br />
Gray overheard his fellow-man soliloquising thus:<br />
"I wonder how the playmates of my youth are getting on,<br />
M'Connell, S. B. Walters, Paddy Byles, and Robinson?"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg&nbsp;258]</a></span>

<br />
These simple words made Peter as delighted as could be;<br />
Old chummies at the Charterhouse were Robinson and he.<br />
He walked straight up to Somers, then he turned extremely red,<br />
Hesitated, hummed and hawed a bit, then cleared his throat, and said:<br />
<br />
"I beg your pardon&mdash;pray forgive me if I seem too bold,<br />
But you have breathed a name I knew familiarly of old.<br />
You spoke aloud of Robinson&mdash;I happened to be by.<br />
You know him?" "Yes, extremely well." "Allow me, so do I."<br />
<br />
It was enough: they felt they could more pleasantly get on,<br />
For (ah, the magic of the fact!) they each knew Robinson!<br />
And Mr. Somers' turtle was at Peter's service quite,<br />
And Mr. Somers punished Peter's oyster-beds all night.<br />
<br />
They soon became like brothers from community of wrongs;<br />
They wrote each other little odes and sang each other songs;<br />
They told each other anecdotes disparaging their wives;<br />
On several occasions, too, they saved each other's lives.<br />
<br />
They felt quite melancholy when they parted for the night,<br />
And got up in the morning soon as ever it was light;<br />
Each other's pleasant company they reckoned so upon,<br />
And all because it happened that they both knew Robinson!<br />
<br />
They lived for many years on that inhospitable shore,<br />
And day by day they learned to love each other more and more.<br />
At last, to their astonishment, on getting up one day,<br />
They saw a frigate anchored in the offing of the bay.<br />
<br />
To Peter an idea occurred. "Suppose we cross the main?<br />
So good an opportunity may not be found again."<br />
And Somers thought a minute, then ejaculated, "Done!<br />
I wonder how my business in the City's getting on?"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg&nbsp;259]</a></span>

<br />
"But stay," said Mr. Peter; "when in England, as you know,<br />
I earned a living tasting teas for Baker, Croop, and Co.,<br />
I may be superseded&mdash;my employers think me dead!"<br />
"Then come with me," said Somers, "and taste indigo instead."<br />
<br />
But all their plans were scattered in a moment when they found<br />
The vessel was a convict ship from Portland outward bound;<br />
When a boat came off to fetch them, though they felt it very kind,<br />
To go on board they firmly but respectfully declined.<br />
<br />
As both the happy settlers roared with laughter at the joke,<br />
They recognized a gentlemanly fellow pulling stroke:<br />
'Twas Robinson&mdash;a convict, in an unbecoming frock!<br />
Condemned to seven years for misappropriating stock!!!<br />
<br />
They laughed no more, for Somers thought he had been rather rash<br />
In knowing one whose friend had misappropriated cash;<br />
And Peter thought a foolish tack he must have gone upon<br />
In making the acquaintance of a friend of Robinson.<br />
<br />
At first they didn't quarrel very openly, I've heard;<br />
They nodded when they met, and now and then exchanged a word:<br />
The word grew rare, and rarer still the nodding of the head.<br />
And when they meet each other now, they cut each other dead.<br />
<br />
To allocate the island they agreed by word of mouth,<br />
And Peter takes the north again, and Somers takes the south;<br />
And Peter has the oysters, which he hates, in layers thick,<br />
And Somers has the turtle&mdash;turtle always makes him sick.<br />

One day, at table, flushed with pride and wine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His honor, proudly free, severely merry,</span><br />
Conceived it would be vastly fine<br />

Thou shalt not covet, but tradition<br />

Dear Thomas, didst thou never pop<br />
Thy head into a tin-man's shop?<br />
There, Thomas, didst thou never see<br />
('Tis but by way of simile)<br />
A squirrel spend his little rage,<br />
In jumping round a rolling cage?<br />
The cage, as either side turn'd up,<br />
Striking a ring of bells a-top?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mov'd in the orb, pleas'd with the chimes,</span><br />
The foolish creature thinks he climbs:<br />
But here or there, turn wood or wire,<br />
He never gets two inches higher.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So fares it with those merry blades,</span><br />
That frisk it under Pindus' shades.<br />
In noble songs, and lofty odes,<br />
They tread on stars, and talk with gods;<br />
Still dancing in an airy round,<br />
Still pleas'd with their own verses' sound;<br />
Brought back, how fast soe'er they go,<br />
Always aspiring, always low.<br />

<h3>THE CONTRAST</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
In London I never know what I'd be at,<br />
Enraptured with this, and enchanted with that;<br />
I'm wild with the sweets of variety's plan,<br />
And life seems a blessing too happy for man.<br />
<br />
But the country, Lord help me! sets all matters right,<br />
So calm and composing from morning to night;<br />
Oh, it settles the spirits when nothing is seen<br />
But an ass on a common, a goose on a green!<br />
<br />
In town, if it rain, why it damps not our hope,<br />
The eye has her choice, and the fancy her scope;<br />
What harm though it pour whole nights or whole days?<br />
It spoils not our prospects, or stops not our ways.<br />
<br />
In the country, what bliss, when it rains in the fields,<br />
To live on the transports that shuttlecock yields;<br />
Or go crawling from window to window, to see<br />
A pig on a dunghill or crow on a tree.<br />
<br />
In town, we've no use for the skies overhead,<br />
For when the sun rises then we go to bed;<br />
And as to that old-fashioned virgin the moon,<br />
She shines out of season, like satin in June.<br />
<br />
In the country, these planets delightfully glare,<br />
Just to show us the object we want isn't there;<br />
Oh, how cheering and gay, when their beauties arise,<br />
To sit and gaze round with the tears in one's eyes!<br />
<br />
But 'tis in the country alone we can find<br />
That happy resource, the relief of the mind,<br />
When, drove to despair, our last efforts we make,<br />
And drag the old fish-pond, for novelty's sake:<br />
<br />
Indeed I must own, 'tis a pleasure complete<br />
To see ladies well-draggled and wet in their feet;<br />
But what is all that to the transport we feel<br />
When we capture, in triumph, two toads and an eel?<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg&nbsp;266]</a></span>

<br />
I have heard though, that love in a cottage is sweet,<br />
When two hearts in one link of soft sympathy meet;<br />
That's to come&mdash;for as yet I, alas! am a swain,<br />
Who require, I own it, more links to my chain.<br />
<br />
In the country, if Cupid should find a man out,<br />
The poor tortured victim mopes hopeless about;<br />
But in London, thank Heaven! our peace is secure,<br />
Where for one eye to kill, there's a thousand to cure.<br />
<br />
In town let me live then, in town let me die,<br />
For in truth I can't relish the country, not I.<br />
If one must have a villa in summer to dwell,<br />
Oh, give me the sweet shady side of Pall Mall!<br />

<h3>THE DEVONSHIRE LANE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
In a Devonshire lane as I trotted along<br />
T'other day, much in want of a subject for song;<br />
Thinks I to myself, I have hit on a strain&mdash;<br />
Sure marriage is much like a Devonshire lane.<br />
<br />
In the first place, 'tis long, and when once you are in it,<br />
It holds you as fast as the cage holds a linnet;<br />
For howe'er rough and dirty the road may be found,<br />
Drive forward you must, since there's no turning round.<br />
<br />
But though 'tis so long, it is not very wide,<br />
For two are the most that together can ride;<br />
And e'en there 'tis a chance but they get in a pother,<br />
And jostle and cross, and run foul of each other.<br />
<br />
Old Poverty greets them with mendicant looks,<br />
And Care pushes by them o'erladen with crooks,<br />
And Strife's grating wheels try between them to pass,<br />
Or Stubbornness blocks up the way on her ass.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg&nbsp;267]</a></span>

<br />
Then the banks are so high, both to left hand and right,<br />
That they shut up the beauties around from the sight;<br />
And hence, you'll allow, 'tis an inference plain<br />
That marriage is just like a Devonshire lane.<br />
<br />
But, thinks I, too, these banks within which we are pent,<br />
With bud, blossom, and berry are richly besprent;<br />
And the conjugal fence which forbids us to roam<br />
Looks lovely when deck'd with the comforts of home.<br />
<br />
In the rock's gloomy crevice the bright holly grows,<br />
The ivy waves fresh o'er the withering rose;<br />
And the evergreen love of a virtuous wife<br />
Smooths the roughness of care&mdash;cheers the winter of life.<br />
<br />
Then long be the journey and narrow the way;<br />
I'll rejoice that I've seldom a turnpike to pay;<br />
And, whate'er others think, be the last to complain,<br />
Though marriage is just like a Devonshire lane.<br />

Delmonico's is where he dines<br />
On quail on toast, washed down with wines;<br />
Then lights a twenty-cent cigar<br />

Gives him a kiss and sweet caress,<br />
And says, "Don't worry so, my dear,<br />

<h3>THE LEARNED NEGRO</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
There was a negro preacher, I have heard,<br />
In Southern parts before rebellion stirred,<br />
Who did not spend his strength in empty sound;<br />
His was a mind deep-reaching and profound.<br />
Others might beat the air, and make a noise,<br />
And help to amuse the silly girls and boys;<br />
But as for him, he was a man of thought,<br />
Deep in theology, although untaught.<br />
He could not read or write, but he was wise,<br />
And knew right smart how to extemporize.<br />
One Sunday morn, when hymns and prayers were said,<br />
The preacher rose and rubbing up his head,<br />
"Bredren and sisterin, and companions dear,<br />
Our preachment for to-day, as you shall hear,<br />
Will be ob de creation,&mdash;ob de plan<br />
On which God fashioned Adam, de fust man.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg&nbsp;275]</a></span>
When God made Adam, in de ancient day,<br />
He made his body out ob earth and clay,<br />
He shape him all out right, den by and by,<br />
He set him up again de fence to dry."<br />
"Stop," said a voice; and straightway there arose<br />
An ancient negro in his master's clothes.<br />
"Tell me," said he, "before you farder go,<br />
One little thing which I should like to know.<br />
It does not quite get through dis niggar's har,<br />
How came dat fence so nice and handy dar?"<br />
Like one who in the mud is tightly stuck,<br />
Or one nonplussed, astonished, thunderstruck,<br />
The preacher looked severely on the pews,<br />
And rubbed his hair to know what words to use:<br />
"Bredren," said he, "dis word I hab to say;<br />
De preacher can't be bothered in dis way;<br />
For, if he is, it's jest as like as not,<br />
Our whole theology will be upsot."<br />

<h3>TRUE TO POLL</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
I'll sing you a song, not very long,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the story somewhat new,</span><br />
Of William Kidd, who, whatever he did,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To his Poll was always true.</span><br />
He sailed away in a galliant ship<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the port of old Bris<i>tol</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the last words he uttered,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As his hankercher he fluttered,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were, "My heart is true to Poll."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His heart was true to Poll,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His heart was true to Poll,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">It's no matter what you do</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">If your heart be only true:</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg&nbsp;276]</a></span>

<br />
'Twas a wreck. Willi<i>am</i>, on shore he swam,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And looked about for an inn;</span><br />
When a noble savage lady, of a color rather shady,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came up with a kind of grin:</span><br />
"Oh, marry <i>me</i>, and a king you'll be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in a palace loll;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or we'll eat you willy-nilly."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So he gave his <i>hand</i>, did Billy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But his <i>heart</i> was true to Poll.</span><br />
<br />
Away a twelvemonth sped, and a happy life he led<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the King of the Kikeryboos;</span><br />
His paint was red and yellar, and he used a big umbrella,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he wore a pair of over-<i>shoes</i>;</span><br />
He'd corals and knives, and twenty-six wives,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose beauties I cannot here extol;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">One day they all revolted,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So he back to Bristol bolted,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For his <i>heart</i> was true to Poll.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His heart was true to Poll,</span><br />

<p>
What motley cares Corilla's mind perplex,<br />
Whom maids and metaphors conspire to vex!<br />
In studious dishabille behold her sit,<br />
A lettered gossip and a household wit;<br />
At once invoking, though for different views,<br />
Her gods, her cook, her milliner and muse.<br />
Round her strewed room a frippery chaos lies,<br />
A checkered wreck of notable and wise,<br />
Bills, books, caps, couplets, combs, a varied mass,<br />
Oppress the toilet and obscure the glass;<br />
Unfinished here an epigram is laid,<br />
And there a mantua-maker's bill unpaid.<br />
There new-born plays foretaste the town's applause,<br />
There dormant patterns pine for future gauze.<br />
A moral essay now is all her care,<br />
A satire next, and then a bill of fare.<br />
A scene she now projects, and now a dish;<br />
Here Act the First, and here, Remove with Fish.<br />
Now, while this eye in a fine frenzy rolls,<br />
That soberly casts up a bill for coals;<br />
Black pins and daggers in one leaf she sticks,<br />
And tears, and threads, and bowls, and thimbles mix.<br />

Marriage and Purgatory are as one."<br />
In bliss extreme he entered heaven's door,<br />

He scarce had entered in the Garden fair,<br />
Another Hindoo asked admission there.<br />
The self-same question Brahma asked again:<br />
"Hast been through Purgatory?" "No; what then?"<br />
"Thou canst not enter!" did the god reply.<br />
"He that went in was no more there than I."<br />
"Yes, that is true, but he has married been,<br />
And so on earth has suffered for all sin."<br />
"Married? 'Tis well; for I've been married twice!"<br />

She cleaned some very old-fashioned lace;<br />
The Countess of Miniver came to her,<br />
"Pray, my dear, will you clean my fur?"<br />
All her cleanings are admirable.<br />
To count your teeth you will be able,<br />
If you look in the walnut table.<br />

She cleaned the tent-stitch and the sampler,<br />
She cleaned the tapestry, which was ampler;<br />
Joseph going down into the pit,<br />

You saw the reapers, <i>not</i> in the distance.<br />
And Elisha, coming to the child's assistance,<br />
With the house on the wall that was built for the prophet,<br />
The chair, the bed and the bolster of it.<br />
The eyebrows all had a twirl reflective,<br />

There was plenty of color but no perspective.<br />

Madam, in mittens, was moved to tears.<br />
<br />
She cleaned the cage of the cockatoo,<br />
The oldest bird that ever grew;<br />
I should say a thousand years old would do.<br />
I'm sure he looked it, but nobody knew;<br />
She cleaned the china, she cleaned the delf,<br />
She cleaned the baby, she cleaned herself!<br />
<br />
Tomorrow morning, she means to try<br />
To clean the cobwebs from the sky;<br />
Some people say the girl will rue it,<br />
But my belief is she will do it.<br />
<br />
So I've made up my mind to be there to see<br />
There's a beautiful place in the walnut tree;<br />
The bough is as firm as a solid rock;<br />
She brings out her broom at six o'clock.<br />

<h3>THE POPE AND THE NET</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
What, he on whom our voices unanimously ran,<br />
Made Pope at our last Conclave? Full low his life began:<br />
His father earned the daily bread as just a fisherman.<br />
<br />
So much the more his boy minds book, gives proof of mother-wit,<br />
Becomes first Deacon, and then Priest, then Bishop: see him sit<br />
No less than Cardinal ere long, while no one cries "Unfit!"<br />
<br />
But some one smirks, some other smiles, jogs elbow and nods head;<br />
Each wings at each: "I' faith, a rise! Saint Peter's net, instead<br />
Of sword and keys, is come in vogue!" You think he blushes red?<br />
<br />
Not he, of humble holy heart! "Unworthy me!" he sighs:<br />
"From fisher's drudge to Church's prince&mdash;it is indeed a rise:<br />
So, here's my way to keep the fact forever in my eyes!"<br />
<br />
And straightway in his palace-hall, where commonly is set<br />
Some coat-of-arms, some portraiture ancestral, lo, we met<br />
His mean estate's reminder in his fisher-father's net!<br />
<br />
Which step conciliates all and some, stops cavil in a trice:<br />
"The humble holy heart that holds of new-born pride no spice!<br />
He's just the saint to choose for Pope!" Each adds, "'Tis my advice."<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg&nbsp;287]</a></span>
<br />
So Pope he was: and when we flocked&mdash;its sacred slipper on&mdash;<br />
To kiss his foot, we lifted eyes, alack, the thing was gone&mdash;<br />
That guarantee of lowlihead,&mdash;eclipsed that star which shone!<br />
<br />
Each eyed his fellow, one and all kept silence. I cried "Pish!<br />
I'll make me spokesman for the rest, express the common wish.<br />
Why, Father, is the net removed?" "Son, it hath caught the fish."<br />

<h3>THAT TEXAN CATTLE MAN</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
We rode the tawny Texan hills,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A bearded cattle man and I;</span><br />
Below us laughed the blossomed rills,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above the dappled clouds blew by.</span><br />
We talked. The topic? Guess. Why, sir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Three-fourths of man's whole time he keeps</span><br />
To talk, to think, to <i>be</i> of <span class="smcap">HER</span>;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The other fourth he sleeps.</span><br />
<br />
To learn what he might know of love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I laughed all constancy to scorn.</span><br />
"Behold yon happy, changeful dove!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Behold this day, all storm at morn,</span><br />
Yet now 't is changed to cloud and sun.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yea, all things change&mdash;the heart, the head,</span><br />
Behold on earth there is not one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That changeth not," I said.</span><br />
<br />
He drew a glass as if to scan<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The plain for steers; raised it and sighed.</span><br />
He craned his neck, this cattle man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then drove the cork home and replied:</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg&nbsp;289]</a></span>
"For twenty years (forgive these tears)&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For twenty years no word of strife&mdash;</span><br />
I have not known for twenty years<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One folly from my wife."</span><br />
<br />
I looked that Texan in the face&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That dark-browed, bearded cattle man,</span><br />
He pulled his beard, then dropped in place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A broad right hand, all scarred and tan,</span><br />
And toyed with something shining there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From out his holster, keen and small.</span><br />
I was convinced. I did not care<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To argue it at all.</span><br />
<br />
But rest I could not. Know I must<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The story of my Texan guide;</span><br />
His dauntless love, enduring trust;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His blessed, immortal bride.</span><br />
I wondered, marvelled, marvelled much.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was she of Texan growth? Was she</span><br />
Of Saxon blood, that boasted such<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Eternal constancy?</span><br />
<br />
I could not rest until I knew&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Now twenty years, my man," said I,</span><br />
"Is a long time." He turned and drew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A pistol forth, also a sigh.</span><br />
"'Tis twenty years or more," said he,<br />

<h3>THE RAZOR SELLER</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
A fellow in a market town,<br />
Most musical, cried razors up and down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And offered twelve for eighteen-pence;</span><br />
Which certainly seemed wondrous cheap,<br />
And for the money quite a heap,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As every man would buy, with cash and sense.</span><br />
<br />
A country bumpkin the great offer heard:<br />
Poor Hodge, who suffered by a broad black beard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That seemed a shoe-brush stuck beneath his nose</span><br />
With cheerfulness the eighteen-pence he paid,<br />
And proudly to himself, in whispers, said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"This rascal stole the razors, I suppose.</span><br />
<br />
"No matter if the fellow <i>be</i> a knave,<br />
Provided that the razors <i>shave</i>;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It certainly will be a monstrous prize."</span><br />
So home the clown, with his good fortune, went,<br />
Smiling in heart and soul, content,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And quickly soaped himself to ears and eyes.</span><br />
<br />
Being well lathered from a dish or tub,<br />
Hodge now began with grinning pain to grub,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just like a hedger cutting furze:</span><br />
'Twas a vile razor!&mdash;then the rest he tried&mdash;<br />
All were imposters&mdash;"Ah," Hodge sighed!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I wish my eighteen-pence within my purse."</span><br />
<br />
In vain to chase his beard, and bring the graces,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He cut, and dug, and winced, and stamped, and swore,</span><br />
Brought blood, and danced, blasphemed, and made wry faces,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cursed each razor's body o'er and o'er:</span><br />
<br />
His muzzle, formed of <i>opposition</i> stuff,<br />
Firm as a Foxite, would not lose its ruff!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So kept it&mdash;laughing at the steel and suds:</span><br />
Hodge, in a passion, stretched his angry jaws,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg&nbsp;298]</a></span>

Vowing the direst vengeance, with clenched claws,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the vile cheat that sold the goods.</span><br />
"Razors; a damned, confounded dog,<br />
Not fit to scrape a hog!"<br />
<br />
Hodge sought the fellow&mdash;found him&mdash;and begun:<br />
"P'rhaps, Master Razor rogue, to you 'tis fun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That people flay themselves out of their lives:</span><br />
You rascal! for an hour have I been grubbing,<br />
Giving my crying whiskers here a scrubbing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With razors just like oyster knives.</span><br />
Sirrah! I tell you, you're a knave,<br />
To cry up razors that can't <i>shave</i>."<br />
"Friend," quoth the razor-man, "I'm not a knave.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As for the razors you have bought,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Upon my soul I never thought</span><br />
That they would <i>shave</i>."<br />
"Not think they'd <i>shave</i>!" quoth Hodge, with wond'ring eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And voice not much unlike an Indian yell;</span><br />
"What were they made for then, you dog?" he cries:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Made!" quoth the fellow, with a smile&mdash;"to <i>sell</i>."</span><br />

<h3>THE DEVIL'S WALK ON EARTH</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
From his brimstone bed at break of day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A walking the Devil is gone,</span><br />
To look at his snug little farm of the World,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And see how his stock went on.</span><br />
<br />
Over the hill and over the dale,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he went over the plain;</span><br />
And backward and forward he swish'd his tail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As a gentleman swishes a cane.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How then was the Devil drest?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, he was in his Sunday's best</span><br />
His coat was red and his breeches were blue,<br />
And there was a hole where his tail came through.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg&nbsp;299]</a></span>

A lady drove by in her pride,<br />
In whose face an expression he spied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For which he could have kiss'd her;</span><br />
Such a flourishing, fine, clever woman was she,<br />
With an eye as wicked as wicked can be,<br />
I should take her for my Aunt, thought he,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If my dam had had a sister.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He met a lord of high degree,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No matter what was his name;</span><br />
Whose face with his own when he came to compare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The expression, the look, and the air,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the character, too, as it seem'd to a hair&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such a twin-likeness there was in the pair</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That it made the Devil start and stare</span><br />
For he thought there was surely a looking-glass there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But he could not see the frame.</span><br />
<br />
He saw a Lawyer killing a viper,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a dung-hill beside his stable;</span><br />
Ha! quoth he, thou put'st me in mind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the story of Cain and Abel.</span><br />
<br />
An Apothecary on a white horse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rode by on his vocation;</span><br />
And the Devil thought of his old friend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Death in the Revelation.</span><br />
<br />
He pass'd a cottage with a double coach-house,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A cottage of gentility,</span><br />
And he own'd with a grin<br />
That his favorite sin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is pride that apes humility.</span><br />
<br />
He saw a pig rapidly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down a river float;</span><br />
The pig swam well, but every stroke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was cutting his own throat;</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg&nbsp;300]</a></span>

<br />
And Satan gave thereat his tail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A twirl of admiration;</span><br />
For he thought of his daughter War,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her suckling babe Taxation.</span><br />
<br />
Well enough, in sooth, he liked that truth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And nothing the worse for the jest;</span><br />
But this was only a first thought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in this he did not rest:</span><br />
Another came presently into his head,<br />
And here it proved, as has often been said<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That second thoughts are best.</span><br />
<br />
For as Piggy plied with wind and tide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His way with such celerity,</span><br />
And at every stroke the water dyed<br />
With his own red blood, the Devil cried,<br />
Behold a swinish nation's pride<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In cotton-spun prosperity.</span><br />
<br />
He walk'd into London leisurely,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The streets were dirty and dim:</span><br />
But there he saw Brothers the Prophet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Brothers the Prophet saw him.</span><br />
<br />
He entered a thriving bookseller's shop;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quoth he, we are both of one college,</span><br />
For I myself sate like a Cormorant once<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the Tree of Knowledge.</span><br />
<br />
As he passed through Cold-Bath Fields he look'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At a solitary cell;</span><br />
And he was well-pleased, for it gave him a hint<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For improving the prisons of Hell.</span><br />
<br />
He saw a turnkey tie a thief's hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a cordial tug and jerk;</span><br />
Nimbly, quoth he, a man's fingers move<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When his heart is in his work.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg&nbsp;301]</a></span>

<br />
He saw the same turnkey unfettering a man<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With little expedition;</span><br />
And he chuckled to think of his dear slave-trade,<br />
And the long debates and delays that were made,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Concerning its abolition.</span><br />
<br />
He met one of his favorite daughters<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By an Evangelical Meeting:</span><br />
And forgetting himself for joy at her sight,<br />
He would have accosted her outright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And given her a fatherly greeting.</span><br />
<br />
But she tipt him the wink, drew back, and cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Avaunt! my name's Religion!</span><br />
And then she turn'd to the preacher<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And leer'd like a love-sick pigeon.</span><br />
<br />
A fine man and a famous Professor was he,<br />
As the great Alexander now may be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whose fame not yet o'erpast is:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or that new Scotch performer</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who is fiercer and warmer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The great Sir Arch-Bombastes.</span><br />
<br />
With throbs and throes, and ah's and oh's.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Far famed his flock for frightning;</span><br />
And thundering with his voice, the while<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His eyes zigzag like lightning.</span><br />
<br />
This Scotch phenomenon, I trow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beats Alexander hollow;</span><br />
Even when most tame<br />
He breathes more flame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then ten Fire-Kings could swallow.</span><br />
<br />
Another daughter he presently met;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With music of fife and drum,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a consecrated flag,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shout of tag and rag,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And march of rank and file,</span><br />
Which had fill'd the crowded aisle<br />
Of the venerable pile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From church he saw her come.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg&nbsp;302]</a></span>
<br />
He call'd her aside, and began to chide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For what dost thou here? said he,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My city of Rome is thy proper home,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And there's work enough there for thee.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou hast confessions to listen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And bells to christen,</span><br />
And altars and dolls to dress;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And fools to coax,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And sinners to hoax,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And beads and bones to bless;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And great pardons to sell</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For those who pay well,</span><br />
And small ones for those who pay less.<br />
<br />
Nay, Father, I boast, that this is my post,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She answered; and thou wilt allow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That the great Harlot,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who is clothed in scarlet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can very well spare me now.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon her business I am come here,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That we may extend our powers:</span><br />
Whatever lets down this church that we hate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is something in favor of ours.</span><br />
<br />
You will not think, great Cosmocrat!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I spend my time in fooling;</span><br />
Many irons, my sire, have we in the fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I must leave none of them cooling;</span><br />
For you must know state-councils here,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are held which I bear rule in.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When my liberal notions,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Produce mischievous motions,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's many a man of good intent,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In either house of Parliament,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whom I shall find a tool in;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I have hopeful pupils too</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who all this while are schooling.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg&nbsp;303]</a></span>

<br />
Fine progress they make in our liberal opinions,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My Utilitarians,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My all sorts of&mdash;inians</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And all sorts of&mdash;arians;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">My all sorts of&mdash;ists,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And my Prigs and my Whigs</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Who have all sorts of twists</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Train'd in the very way, I know,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Father, you would have them go;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">High and low,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wise and foolish, great and small,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">March-of-Intellect-Boys all.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well pleased wilt thou be at no very far day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When the caldron of mischief boils,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I bring them forth in battle array</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And bid them suspend their broils,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That they may unite and fall on the prey,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For which we are spreading our toils.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How the nice boys all will give mouth at the call,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hark away! hark away to the spoils!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My Macs and my Quacks and my lawless-Jacks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My Shiels and O'Connells, my pious Mac-Donnells,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My joke-smith Sydney, and all of his kidney,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">My Humes and my Broughams,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">My merry old Jerry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My Lord Kings, and my Doctor Doyles!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At this good news, so great</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Devil's pleasure grew,</span><br />
That with a joyful swish he rent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The hole where his tail came through.</span><br />
<br />
His countenance fell for a moment<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he felt the stitches go;</span><br />
Ah! thought he, there's a job now<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I've made for my tailor below.</span><br />
<br />
Great news! bloody news! cried a newsman;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Devil said, Stop, let me see!</span><br />
Great news? bloody news? thought the Devil,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bloodier the better for me.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg&nbsp;304]</a></span>
<br />
So he bought the newspaper, and no news<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At all for his money he had.</span><br />
Lying varlet, thought he, thus to take in old Nick!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But it's some satisfaction, my lad,</span><br />
To know thou art paid beforehand for the trick,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the sixpence I gave thee is bad.</span><br />
<br />
And then it came into his head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By oracular inspiration,</span><br />
That what he had seen and what he had said<br />
In the course of this visitation,<br />
Would be published in the Morning Post<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For all this reading nation.</span><br />
<br />
Therewith in second sight he saw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The place and the manner and time,</span><br />
In which this mortal story<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would be put in immortal rhyme.</span><br />
<br />
That it would happen when two poets<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should on a time be met,</span><br />
In the town of Nether Stowey,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the shire of Somerset.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There while the one was shaving</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Would he the song begin;</span><br />
And the other when he heard it at breakfast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In ready accord join in.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So each would help the other,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Two heads being better than one;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the phrase and conceit</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Would in unison meet,</span><br />
And so with glee the verse flow free,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In ding-dong chime of sing-song rhyme,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till the whole were merrily done.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And because it was set to the razor,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Not to the lute or harp,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therefore it was that the fancy</span><br />
Should be bright, and the wit be sharp.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg&nbsp;305]</a></span>

<br />
But, then, said Satan to himself,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As for that said beginner,</span><br />
Against my infernal Majesty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is no greater sinner.</span><br />
<br />
He hath put me in ugly ballads<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With libelous pictures for sale;</span><br />
He hath scoff'd at my hoofs and my horns,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And has made very free with my tail.</span><br />
<br />
But this Mister Poet shall find<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am not a safe subject for whim;</span><br />
For I'll set up a School of my own,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And my Poets shall set upon him.</span><br />
<br />
He went to a coffee-house to dine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there he had soy in his dish;</span><br />
Having ordered some soles for his dinner,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because he was fond of flat fish.</span><br />
<br />
They are much to my palate, thought he,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now guess the reason who can,</span><br />
Why no bait should be better than place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I fish for a Parliament-man.</span><br />
<br />
But the soles in the bill were ten shillings;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tell your master, quoth he, what I say;</span><br />
If he charges at this rate for all things,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He must be in a pretty good way.</span><br />
<br />
But mark ye, said he to the waiter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'm a dealer myself in this line,</span><br />
And his business, between you and me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nothing like so extensive as mine.</span><br />
<br />
Now soles are exceedingly cheap,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which he will not attempt to deny,</span><br />
When I see him at my fish-market,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I warrant him, by-and-by.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg&nbsp;306]</a></span>

<br />
As he went along the Strand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Between three in the morning and four</span><br />
He observed a queer-looking person<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who staggered from Perry's door.</span><br />
<br />
And he thought that all the world over<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In vain for a man you might seek,</span><br />
Who could drink more like a Trojan<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or talk more like a Greek.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Devil then he prophesied</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It would one day he matter of talk,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That with wine when smitten,</span><br />
And with wit moreover being happily bitten,<br />
The erudite bibber was he who had written<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The story of this walk.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A pretty mistake, quoth the Devil;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A pretty mistake I opine!</span><br />
I have put many ill thoughts in his mouth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He will never put good ones in mine.</span><br />
<br />
And whoever shall say that to Porson<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These best of all verses belong,</span><br />
He is an untruth-telling whore-son,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so shall be call'd in the song.</span><br />
<br />
And if seeking an illicit connection with fame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Any one else should put in a claim,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In this comical competition;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That excellent poem will prove</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A man-trap for such foolish ambition,</span><br />
Where the silly rogue shall be caught by the leg,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And exposed in a second edition.</span><br />
<br />
Now the morning air was cold for him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who was used to a warm abode;</span><br />
And yet he did not immediately wish,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To set out on his homeward road.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg&nbsp;307]</a></span>
<br />

<h3>FATHER MOLLOY</h3>

<h4>OR, THE CONFESSION</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Paddy McCabe was dying one day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Father Molloy he came to confess him;</span><br />
Paddy pray'd hard he would make no delay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But forgive him his sins and make haste for to bless him.</span><br />
"First tell me your sins," says Father Molloy,<br />
"For I'm thinking you've not been a very good boy."<br />
"Oh," says Paddy, "so late in the evenin', I fear,<br />
'Twould throuble you such a long story to hear,<br />
For you've ten long miles o'er the mountains to go,<br />
While the road <i>I've</i> to travel's much longer, you know.<br />
So give us your blessin' and get in the saddle,<br />
To tell all my sins my poor brain it would addle;<br />
And the docther gave ordhers to keep me so quiet&mdash;<br />
'Twould disturb me to tell all my sins, if I'd thry it,<br />
And your Reverence has towld us, unless we tell <i>all</i>,<br />
'Tis worse than not makin' confession at all.<br />
So I'll say in a word I'm no very good boy&mdash;<br />
And, therefore, your blessin', sweet Father Molloy."<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg&nbsp;308]</a></span>
<br />
"Well, I'll read from a book," says Father Molloy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The manifold sins that humanity's heir to;</span><br />
And when you hear those that your conscience annoy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You'll just squeeze my hand, as acknowledging thereto."</span><br />
Then the father began the dark roll of iniquity,<br />
And Paddy, thereat, felt his conscience grow rickety,<br />
And he gave such a squeeze that the priest gave a roar&mdash;<br />
"Oh, murdher," says Paddy, "don't read any more,<br />
For, if you keep readin', by all that is thrue,<br />
Your Reverence's fist will be soon black and blue;<br />
Besides, to be throubled my conscience begins,<br />
That your Reverence should have any hand in my sins,<br />
So you'd betther suppose I committed them all,<br />
For whether they're great ones, or whether they're small,<br />
Or if they're a dozen, or if they're fourscore,<br />
'Tis your Reverence knows how to absolve them, asthore;<br />
So I'll say in a word, I'm no very good boy&mdash;<br />
And, therefore, your blessin', sweet Father Molloy."<br />
<br />
"Well," says Father Molloy, "if your sins I forgive,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So you must forgive all your enemies truly;</span><br />
And promise me also that, if you should live,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You'll leave off your old tricks, and begin to live newly."</span><br />
"I forgive ev'rybody," says Pat, with a groan,<br />
"Except that big vagabone Micky Malone;<br />
And him I will murdher if ever I can&mdash;"<br />
"Tut, tut," says the priest, "you're a very bad man;<br />
For without your forgiveness, and also repentance,<br />
You'll ne'er go to Heaven, and that is my sentence."<br />
"Poo!" says Paddy McCabe, "that's a very hard case&mdash;<br />
With your Reverence and Heaven I'm content to make pace;<br />
But with Heaven and your Reverence I wondher&mdash;<i>Och hone</i>&mdash;<br />
You would think of comparin' that blackguard Malone&mdash;<br />
But since I'm hard press'd and that I <i>must</i> forgive,<br />
I forgive&mdash;if I die&mdash;but as sure as I live<br />
That ugly blackguard I will surely desthroy!&mdash;<br />
So, <i>now</i> for your blessin', sweet Father Molloy!"<br />

<h3>THE OWL-CRITIC</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
"Who stuffed that white owl?" No one spoke in the shop,<br />
The barber was busy, and he couldn't stop;<br />
The customers, waiting their turns, were all reading<br />
The "Daily," the "Herald," the "Post," little heeding<br />
The young man who blurted out such a blunt question;<br />
Not one raised a head, or even made a suggestion;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And the barber kept on shaving.</span><br />
<br />
"Don't you see, Mr. Brown,"<br />
Cried the youth, with a frown,<br />
"How wrong the whole thing is,<br />
How preposterous each wing is<br />
How flattened the head is, how jammed down the neck is&mdash;<br />
In short, the whole owl, what an ignorant wreck 't is!<br />
I make no apology;<br />
I've learned owl-eology.<br />
<br />
I've passed days and nights in a hundred collections,<br />
And cannot be blinded to any deflections<br />
Arising from unskilful fingers that fail<br />
To stuff a bird right, from his beak to his tail.<br />
Mister Brown! Mister Brown!<br />
Do take that bird down,<br />
Or you'll soon be the laughing-stock all over town!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And the barber kept on shaving.</span><br />
<br />
"I've <i>studied</i> owls,<br />
And other night-fowls,<br />
And I tell you<br />
What I know to be true;<br />
An owl cannot roost<br />
With his limbs so unloosed;<br />
No owl in this world<br />
Ever had his claws curled,<br />
Ever had his legs slanted,<br />
Ever had his bill canted,<br />
Ever had his neck screwed<br />
Into that attitude.<br />
He can't <i>do</i> it, because<br />
'Tis against all bird-laws.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg&nbsp;310]</a></span>
<br />
Anatomy teaches,<br />
Ornithology preaches,<br />
An owl has a toe<br />
That <i>can't</i> turn out so!<br />
I've made the white owl my study for years,<br />
And to see such a job almost moves me to tears!<br />
Mr. Brown, I'm amazed<br />
You should be so gone crazed<br />
As to put up a bird<br />
In that posture absurd!<br />
To <i>look</i> at that owl really brings on a dizziness;<br />
The man who stuffed <i>him</i> don't half know his business!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And the barber kept on shaving.</span><br />
<br />
"Examine those eyes.<br />
I'm filled with surprise<br />
Taxidermists should pass<br />
Off on you such poor glass;<br />
So unnatural they seem<br />
They'd make Audubon scream,<br />
And John Burroughs laugh<br />
To encounter such chaff.<br />
Do take that bird down;<br />
Have him stuffed again, Brown!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And the barber kept on shaving.</span><br />
<br />
"With some sawdust and bark<br />
I could stuff in the dark<br />
An owl better than that.<br />
I could make an old hat<br />
Look more like an owl<br />
Than that horrid fowl,<br />
Stuck up there so stiff like a side of coarse leather.<br />
In fact, about <i>him</i> there's not one natural feather."<br />
<br />
Just then, with a wink and a sly normal lurch,<br />
The owl, very gravely, got down from his perch,<br />
Walked round, and regarded his fault-finding critic<br />
(Who thought he was stuffed) with a glance analytic,<br />
And then fairly hooted, as if he should say:<br />
"Your learning's at fault <i>this</i> time, anyway;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg&nbsp;311]</a></span>

Don't waste it again on a live bird, I pray.<br />
I'm an owl; you're another. Sir Critic, good day!"<br />

An everlasting foe, with watchful eye<br />
Lies nightly brooding o'er a chinky gap,<br />
Portending her fell claws, to thoughtless mice<br />
Sure ruin. So her disembowell'd web<br />
Arachne, in a hall or kitchen, spreads<br />
Obvious to vagrant flies: she secret stands<br />
Within her woven cell: the humming prey,<br />
Regardless of their fate, rush on the toils<br />
Inextricable, nor will aught avail<br />
Their arts, or arms, or shapes of lovely hue;<br />
The wasp insidious, and the buzzing drone,<br />
And butterfly, proud of expanded wings<br />
Distinct with gold, entangled in her snares,<br />
Useless resistance make; with eager strides,<br />
She towering flies to her expected spoils;<br />
Then, with envenomed jaws, the vital blood<br />
Drinks of reluctant foes, and to her cave<br />
Their bulky carcasses triumphant drags.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So pass my days. But when nocturnal shades</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg&nbsp;319]</a></span>

This world envelop, and th' inclement air<br />
Persuades men to repel benumbing frosts<br />
With pleasant wines, and crackling blaze of wood;<br />
Me, lonely sitting, nor the glimmering light<br />
Of make-weight candle, nor the joyous talk<br />
Of loving friend, delights: distress'd, forlorn,<br />
Amidst the horrors of the tedious night,<br />
Darkling I sigh, and feed with dismal thoughts<br />
My anxious mind: or sometimes mournful verse<br />
Indite, and sing of groves and myrtle shades,<br />
Or desperate lady near a purling stream,<br />
Or lover pendent on a willow tree.<br />
Meanwhile I labor with eternal drought,<br />
And restless wish, and rave; my parched throat<br />
Finds no relief, nor heavy eyes repose:<br />
But if a slumber haply does invade<br />
My weary limbs, my fancy's still awake,<br />
Thoughtful of drink, and eager, in a dream,<br />
Tipples imaginary pots of ale,<br />
In vain; awake I find the settled thirst<br />
Still gnawing, and the pleasant phantom curse.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus do I live, from pleasure quite debarred,</span><br />
Nor taste the fruits that the sun's genial rays<br />
Mature, john-apple, nor the downy peach,<br />
Nor walnut in rough-furrow'd coat secure,<br />
Nor medlar, fruit delicious in decay;<br />
Afflictions great! yet greater still remain:<br />
My galligaskins, that have long withstood<br />
The winter's fury, and encroaching frosts,<br />
By time subdued (what will not time subdue!)<br />
An horrid chasm disclos'd with orifice<br />
Wide, discontinuous; at which the winds<br />
Eurus and Auster, and the dreadful force<br />
Of Boreas, that congeals the Cronian waves,<br />
Tumultuous enter with dire chilling blasts,<br />
Portending agues. Thus a well-fraught ship,<br />
Long sail'd secure, or through th' &AElig;gean deep,<br />
Or the Ionian, till cruising near<br />
The Lilybean shore, with hideous crush<br />
On Scylla, or Charybdis (dangerous rocks!)<br />
She strikes rebounding; whence the shatter'd oak,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg&nbsp;320]</a></span>

So fierce a shock unable to withstand,<br />
Admits the sea: in at the gaping side<br />
The crowding waves gush with impetuous rage<br />
Resistless, overwhelming; horrors seize<br />
The mariners; Death in their eyes appears,<br />
They stare, they lave, they pump, they swear, they pray<br />
(Vain efforts!) still the battering waves rush in,<br />
Implacable, till, delug'd by the foam,<br />
The ship sinks foundering in the vast abyss.<br />

<h3>AFTER HORACE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
What asks the Bard? He prays for nought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But what the truly virtuous crave:</span><br />
That is, the things he plainly ought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To have.</span><br />
<br />
'Tis not for wealth, with all the shocks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That vex distracted millionaires,</span><br />
Plagued by their fluctuating stocks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And shares:</span><br />
<br />
While plutocrats their millions new<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Expend upon each costly whim,</span><br />
A great deal less than theirs will do<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For him:</span><br />
<br />
The simple incomes of the poor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His meek poetic soul content:</span><br />
Say, &pound;30,000 at four<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Per cent.!</span><br />
<br />
His taste in residence is plain:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No palaces his heart rejoice:</span><br />
A cottage in a lane (Park Lane<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For choice)&mdash;</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg&nbsp;321]</a></span>

<br />
Here be his days in quiet spent:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here let him meditate the Muse:</span><br />
Baronial Halls were only meant<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For Jews,</span><br />
<br />
And lands that stretch with endless span<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From east to west, from south to north,</span><br />
Are often much more trouble than<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">They're worth!</span><br />
<br />
Let epicures who eat too much<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Become uncomfortably stout:</span><br />
Let gourmets feel th' approaching touch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Of gout,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
The Bard subsists on simpler food:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dinner, not severely plain,</span><br />
A pint or so of really good<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Champagne&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Grant him but these, no care he'll take<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though Laureates bask in Fortune's smile,</span><br />
Though Kiplings and Corellis make<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Their pile:</span><br />
<br />
Contented with a scantier dole<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His humble Muse serenely jogs,</span><br />
Remote from scenes where authors roll<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Their logs:</span><br />
<br />
Far from the madding crowd she lurks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And really cares no single jot</span><br />
Whether the public read her works<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Or not!</span><br />

<h3>OF A PRECISE TAILOR</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
A tailor, a man of an upright dealing,<br />
True but for lying, honest but for stealing,<br />
Did fall one day extremely sick by chance,<br />
And on the sudden was in wondrous trance.<br />
The Fiends of hell, mustering in fearful manner,<br />
Of sundry-coloured silks displayed a banner,<br />
Which he had stol'n; and wished, as they did tell,<br />
That one day he might find it all in hell.<br />
The man, affrighted at this apparition,<br />
Upon recovery grew a great precisian.<br />
He bought a Bible of the new translation,<br />
And in his life he showed great reformation.<br />
He walk&egrave;d mannerly and talk&egrave;d meekly;<br />
He heard three lectures and two sermons weekly;<br />
He vowed to shun all companies unruly,<br />
And in his speech he used no oath but "truly":<br />
And, zealously to keep the Sabbath's rest,<br />
His meat for that day on the even was dressed.<br />
And, lest the custom that he had to steal<br />
Might cause him sometime to forget his zeal,<br />
He gives his journeyman a special charge<br />
That, if the stuff allowed fell out too large,<br />
And that to filch his fingers were inclined,<br />
He then should put the Banner in his mind.<br />
This done, I scant the rest can tell for laughter.<br />
A Captain of a ship came three days after,<br />
And bought three yards of velvet and three quarters,<br />
To make Venetians down below the garters.<br />
He, that precisely knew what was enough,<br />
Soon slipped away three quarters of the stuff.<br />
His man, espying it, said in derision,<br />
"Remember, Master, how you saw the vision!"<br />
"Peace, knave," quoth he; "I did not see one rag<br />
Of such-a-coloured silk in all the flag."<br />

He lived in a cave by the seas,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He lived upon oysters and foes,</span><br />
But his list of forbidden degrees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An extensive morality shows;</span><br />
Geological evidence goes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To prove he had never a pan,</span><br />
But he shaved with a shell when he chose,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas the manner of Primitive Man.</span><br />
<br />
He worshipp'd the rain and the breeze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He worshipp'd the river that flows,</span><br />
And the Dawn, and the Moon, and the trees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bogies, and serpents, and crows;</span><br />
He buried his dead with their toes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tucked-up, an original plan,</span><br />
Till their knees came right under their nose,&mdash;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(As another philosopher trows):</span><br />
When he spoke, it was never in prose,<br />

Each life's unfulfilled, you see;<br />

<p class='poem'>While her tones, unspoiled, unstudied, had the softness of the dove.</p>

<p class='poem'>And the way she gave "Young Grayhead" would have liquefied a stone.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>I was forced to look upon her in my desperation dumb,</p>
<p class='poem'>Knowing well that when her awful opportunity was come</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lamentin' her viduity.</span><br />
Her grief brak out sae fierce and fell,<br />
I thought her heart wad burst the shell;<br />
And,&mdash;I was sae left to mysel',&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I sell't her an annuity.</span><br />
<br />
The bargain lookit fair eneugh&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She just was turned o' saxty-three&mdash;</span><br />
I couldna guessed she'd prove sae teugh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By human ingenuity.</span><br />
But years have come, and years have gane,<br />
And there she's yet as stieve as stane&mdash;<br />
The limmer's growin' young again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since she got her annuity.</span><br />
<br />
She's crined' awa' to bane and skin,<br />

She's like to live&mdash;although she's in<br />

She munches wi' her wizen'd gums,<br />
An' stumps about on legs o' thrums;<br />
But comes, as sure as Christmas comes,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For an insurance company;</span><br />
Her chance o' life was stated there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wi' perfect perspicuity.</span><br />
But tables here or tables there,<br />
She's lived ten years beyond her share,<br />

Last Yule she had a fearfu' host,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I thought a kink might set me free&mdash;</span><br />
I led her out, 'mang snaw and frost,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wi' constant assiduity.</span><br />
But deil ma' care&mdash;the blast gaed by,<br />
And miss'd the auld anatomy&mdash;<br />
It just cost me a tooth, for bye<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Discharging her annuity.</span><br />
<br />
If there's a' sough o' cholera,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or typhus,&mdash;wha sae gleg as she?</span><br />

The pest walked o'er her very roof&mdash;<br />
She tauld me sae&mdash;an' then her loof<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Held out for her annuity.</span><br />
<br />
Ae day she fell, her arm she brak&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A compound fracture as could be&mdash;</span><br />
Nae leech the cure wad undertake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whate'er was the gratuity.</span><br />
It's cured! She handles 't like a flail&mdash;<br />
It does as weel in bits as hale&mdash;<br />
But I'm a broken man mysel'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wi' her and her annuity.</span><br />
<br />
Her broozled flesh and broken banes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are weel as flesh and banes can be.</span><br />
She beats the taeds that live in stanes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' fatten in vacuity!</span><br />
They die when they're exposed to air&mdash;<br />
They canna thole the atmosphere;<br />
But her!&mdash;expose her onywhere&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She lives for her annuity.</span><br />
<br />
If mortal means could nick her thread,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sma' crime it wad appear to me;</span><br />
Ca't murder, or ca't homicide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd justify 't&mdash;an' do it tae.</span><br />

<br />
I'd try a shot: but whar's the mark?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her vital parts are hid frae me;</span><br />
Her backbane wanders through her sark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In an unkenn'd corkscrewity.</span><br />
She's palsified&mdash;an shakes her head<br />
Sae fast about, ye scarce can see;<br />
It's past the power o' steel or lead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To settle her annuity.</span><br />
<br />
She might be drowned&mdash;but go she'll not<br />

Or hanged&mdash;if cord could grip a throat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O' siccan exiguity.</span><br />
It's fitter far to hang the rope&mdash;<br />
It draws out like a telescope;<br />
'Twad tak a dreadfu' length o' drop<br />

<br />
Will puzion do't?&mdash;It has been tried;<br />

That's just the dish she can't abide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whatever kind o' gout it hae.</span><br />
It's needless to assail her doubts,<br />
She gangs by instinct, like the brutes,<br />
An' only eats an' drinks what suits<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hersel' and her annuity.</span><br />

The Bible says the age o' man<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Explain the incongruity.</span><br />
She should hae lived afore the flood&mdash;<br />
She's come o' patriarchal blood,<br />
She's some auld Pagan mummified<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Alive for her annuity.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg&nbsp;353]</a></span>

<br />
She's been embalmed inside and oot&mdash;<br />

There's pickle in her very snoot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sae caper-like an' cruety.</span><br />
Lot's wife was fresh compared to her&mdash;<br />
They've kyanized the useless knir,<br />
She canna decompose&mdash;nae mair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than her accursed annuity.</span><br />
<br />
The water-drop wears out the rock,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As this eternal jaud wears me;</span><br />
I could withstand the single shock,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But not the continuity.</span><br />

Life consists of paying bills as long as you have health;<br />
Woman? She'll be true to you&mdash;as long as you have wealth;<br />
Think sometimes of marriage, if the right girl I could strike;<br />

Father really foolish in his fond paternal joy;<br />

<h3>LOVERS AND A REFLECTION</h3>

<p>
In moss-prankt dells which the sunbeams flatter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And heaven it knoweth what that may mean;</span><br />
Meaning, however, is no great matter)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where woods are a-tremble with words a-tween;</span><br />
<br />
Thro' God's own heather we wonned together,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I and my Willie (O love my love):</span><br />
I need hardly remark it was glorious weather,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And flitter-bats wavered alow, above:</span><br />
<br />
Boats were curtseying, rising, bowing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Boats in that climate are so polite,)</span><br />
And sands were a ribbon of green endowing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And O the sun-dazzle on bark and bight!</span><br />
<br />
Thro' the rare red heather we danced together<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(O love my Willie,) and smelt for flowers:</span><br />
I must mention again it was glorious weather,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rhymes are so scarce in this world of ours:</span><br />
<br />
By rises that flushed with their purple favors,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thro' becks that brattled o'er grasses sheen,</span><br />
We walked or waded, we two young shavers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thanking our stars we were both so green.</span><br />
<br />
We journeyed in parallels, I and Willie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In fortunate parallels! Butterflies,</span><br />
Hid in weltering shadows of daffodilly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or Marjoram, kept making peacock eyes:</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg&nbsp;373]</a></span>

<br />
Song-birds darted about, some inky<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As coal, some snowy (I ween) as curds;</span><br />
Or rosy as pinks, or as roses pinky&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They reck of no eerie To-come, those birds!</span><br />
<br />
But they skim over bents which the mill-stream washes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or hang in the lift 'neath a white cloud's hem;</span><br />
They need no parasols, no goloshes;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And good Mrs. Trimmer she feedeth them.</span><br />
<br />
Then we thrid God's cowslips (as erst his heather),<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That endowed the wan grass with their golden blooms;</span><br />
And snapt&mdash;(it was perfectly charming weather)&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our fingers at Fate and her goddess-glooms:</span><br />
<br />
And Willie 'gan sing&mdash;(Oh, his notes were fluty;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wafts fluttered them out to the white-winged sea)&mdash;</span><br />
Something made up of rhymes that have done much duty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rhymes (better to put it) of "ancientry":</span><br />
<br />
Bowers of flowers encountered showers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In William's carol&mdash;(O love my Willie!)</span><br />
Then he bade sorrow borrow from blithe to-morrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I quite forget what&mdash;say a daffodilly.</span><br />
<br />
A nest in a hollow, "with buds to follow,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I think occurred next in his nimble strain;</span><br />
And clay that was "kneaden" of course in Eden&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A rhyme most novel I do maintain:</span><br />
<br />
Mists, bones, the singer himself, love-stories,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all least furlable things got furled;</span><br />
Not with any design to conceal their glories,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But simply and solely to rhyme with world.</span><br />
<br />
O if billows and pillows and hours and flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the brave rhymes of an elder day,</span><br />
Could be furled together, this genial weather,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And carted or carried on wafts away,</span><br />
Nor ever again trotted out&mdash;ah me!<br />
How much fewer volumes of verse there'd be.<br />

Calm and implacable,<br />
Eying disdainfully the world beneath,<br />
Sat Humpty-Dumpty on his mural eminence<br />
In solemn state:<br />
And I relate his story<br />
In verse unfettered by the bothering restrictions of rhyme or metre,<br />
In verse (or "rhythm," as I prefer to call it)<br />
Which, consequently, is far from difficult to write.<br />
<br />
He sat. And at his feet<br />
The world passed on&mdash;the surging crowd<br />
Of men and women, passionate, turgid, dense,<br />
Keenly alert, lethargic, or obese.<br />
(Those two lines scan!)<br />
<br />
Among the rest<br />
He noted Jones; Jones with his Roman nose,<br />
His eyebrows&mdash;the left one streaked with a dash of gray&mdash;<br />
And yellow boots.<br />
Not that Jones<br />
Has anything in particular to do with the story;<br />
But a descriptive phrase<br />
Like the above shows that the writer is<br />
A Master of Realism.<br />
<br />
Let us proceed. Suddenly from his seat<br />
Did Humpty-Dumpty slip. Vainly he clutched<br />
The impalpable air. Down and down,<br />
Right to the foot of the wall,<br />

Right on to the horribly hard pavement that ran beneath it,<br />
Humpty-Dumpty, the unfortunate Humpty-Dumpty,<br />
Fell.<br />
<br />
And him, alas! no equine agency,<br />
Him no power of regal battalions&mdash;<br />
Resourceful, eager, strenuous&mdash;<br />
Could ever restore to the lofty eminence<br />
Which once was his.<br />
Still he lies on the very identical<br />
Spot where he fell&mdash;lies, as I said on the ground,<br />
Shamefully and conspicuously abased!<br />

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> A Shrawn is a pure Gaelic noise, something like a groan,
more like a shriek, and most like a sigh of longing.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Eire was daughter of Carne, King of Connaught. Her lover,
Murdh of the Open Hand, was captured by Greatcoat Mackintosh,
King of Ulster, on the plain of Carrisbool, and made into
soup. Eire's grief on this sad occasion has become proverbial.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Garnim was second cousin to Manannan MacLir. His sons
were always sad about something. There were twenty-two of
them, and they were all unfortunate in love at the same time, just
like a chorus at the opera. "Blitherin' their drool" is about the
same as "dreeing their weird."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The Shee (or "Sidhe," as I should properly spell it if you
were not so ignorant) were, as everybody knows, the regular,
stand-pat, organization fairies of Erin. The Crowdie was their
annual convention, at which they made melancholy sounds. The
Itt and Himm were the irregular, or insurgent, fairies. They
<i>never</i> got any offices or patronage. See MacAlester, <i>Polity of
the Sidhe of West Meath</i>, page 985.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The Barryhoo is an ancient Celtic bird about the size of a
Mavis, with lavender eyes and a black-crape tail. It continually
mourns its mate (Barrywhich, feminine form), which has an
hereditary predisposition to an early and tragic demise and
invariably dies first.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Magraw, a Gaelic term of endearment, often heard on the
baseball fields of Donnybrook.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> These last six words are all that tradition has preserved of
the original incantation by means of which Irish rats were rhymed
to death. Thereby hangs a good Celtic tale, which I should be
glad to tell you in this note; but the publishers say that being
prosed to death is as bad as being rhymed to death, and that
the readers won't stand for any more.</p></div>

No usual words can bear the woe I feel,<br />
No tralatitions trite give me relief!<br />
O Webster! lend me words to voice my grief<br />
Bitter as quassia, quass or kumquat peel!<br />
For I am sad ... bound on the cosmic wheel,<br />
What mad chthonophagy bids slave and chief<br />
Through endless cycles bite the earth like beef,<br />

Turn we to nature, Webster, and we find<br />
Few creatures have a quite contented mind.<br />
Your koulan there, with dyslogistic snort,<br />
Will leave his phacoid food on worts to browse,<br />
While glactophorous Himalayan cows<br />
The knurled kohl-rabi spurn in uncouth sport;<br />
No margay climbs margosa trees; the short<br />
Gray mullet drink no mulse, nor house<br />
In pibcorns when the youth of Wales carouse ...<br />
No tournure doth the toucan's tail contort ...<br />
So I am sad! ... and yet, on Summer eves,<br />
When xebecs search the whishing scree for whelk,<br />
And the sharp sorrel lifts obcordate leaves,<br />
And cryptogamous plants fulfil the elk,<br />
I see the octopus play with his feet,<br />
And find within this sadness something sweet.<br />

<p>The thing we like about that poem is its recognition of all
the sorrow there is in the universe ... its <i>unflinching</i> recognition,
we might say, if we were not afraid of praising our own
work too highly ... combined with its happy ending.</p>

<p>One feels, upon reading it, that, although everything everywhere
is very sad, and all wrong, one has only to have patience
and after a while everything everywhere will be quite right and
very sweet.</p>

<p>No matter how interested one may be in these literary problems,
one must cease discussing them at times or one will be
late to one's meals.</p>

<h3>YOUNG LOCHINVAR</h3>

<h4>THE TRUE STORY IN BLANK VERSE</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Oh! young Lochinvar has come out of the West,<br />
Thro' all the wide border his horse has no equal,<br />
Having cost him forty-five dollars at the market,<br />
Where good nags, fresh from the country,<br />
With burrs still in their tails are selling<br />
For a song; and save his good broad sword<br />
He weapon had none, except a seven-shooter<br />
Or two, a pair of brass knuckles, and an Arkansaw<br />
<br />
Toothpick in his boot, so, comparatively speaking,<br />
He rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone,<br />
Because there was no one going his way.<br />
He stayed not for brake, and he stopped not for<br />
Toll-gates; he swam the Eske River where ford<br />
There was none, and saved fifteen cents<br />
In ferriage, but lost his pocket-book, containing<br />
Seventeen dollars and a half, by the operation.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg&nbsp;382]</a></span>

Ere he alighted at the Netherby mansion<br />
He stopped to borrow a dry suit of clothes,<br />
And this delayed him considerably, so when<br />
He arrived the bride had consented&mdash;the gallant<br />
Came late&mdash;for a laggard in love and a dastard in war<br />
Was to wed the fair Ellen, and the guests had assembled.<br />
<br />
So, boldly he entered the Netherby Hall<br />
Among bridesmen and kinsmen and brothers and<br />
Brothers-in-law and forty or fifty cousins;<br />
Then spake the bride's father, his hand on his sword<br />
(For the poor craven bridegroom ne'er opened his head)<br />
<br />
"Oh, come ye in peace here, or come ye in anger,<br />
Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?"<br />
"I long wooed your daughter, and she will tell you<br />
I have the inside track in the free-for-all<br />
For her affections! my suit you denied; but let<br />
That pass, while I tell you, old fellow, that love<br />
Swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide,<br />
And now I am come with this lost love of mine<br />
To lead but one measure, drink one glass of beer;<br />
There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far<br />
That would gladly be bride to yours very truly."<br />
<br />
The bride kissed the goblet, the knight took it up,<br />
He quaffed off the nectar and threw down the mug,<br />
Smashing it into a million pieces, while<br />
He remarked that he was the son of a gun<br />
From Seven-up and run the Number Nine.<br />
She looked down to blush, but she looked up again<br />
For she well understood the wink in his eye;<br />
He took her soft hand ere her mother could<br />
Interfere, "Now tread we a measure; first four<br />
Half right and left; swing," cried young Lochinvar.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg&nbsp;383]</a></span>

<br />
One touch to her hand and one word in her ear,<br />
When they reached the hall door and the charger<br />
Stood near on three legs eating post hay;<br />
So light to the croup the fair lady he swung,<br />
Then leaped to the saddle before her.<br />
"She is won! we are gone! over bank, bush, and spar,<br />
They'll have swift steeds that follow"&mdash;but in the<br />
<br />
Excitement of the moment he had forgotten<br />
To untie the horse, and the poor brute could<br />
Only gallop in a little circus around the<br />
Hitching-post; so the old gent collared<br />
The youth and gave him the awfullest lambasting<br />
That was ever heard of on Canobie Lee;<br />
So dauntless in war and so daring in love,<br />
Have ye e'er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?<br />

We love thee, Ann Maria Smith,<br />

There's Cupid's arrow in thy glance,<br />

<h4>A BURLESQUE IMITATION OF WORDSWORTH&mdash;REJECTED
ADDRESSES</h4>

<div class='blockquot'><p>[Spoken in the character of Nancy Lake, a girl eight years of
age, who is drawn upon the stage in a child's chaise by Samuel
Hughes, her uncle's porter.]</p></div>

<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
My brother Jack was nine in May,<br />
And I was eight on New-year's-day;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So in Kate Wilson's shop</span><br />
Papa (he's my papa and Jack's)<br />
Bought me, last week, a doll of wax,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And brother Jack a top.</span><br />
Jack's in the pouts, and this it is&mdash;<br />
He thinks mine came to more than his;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg&nbsp;391]</a></span>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So to my drawer he goes,</span><br />
Takes out the doll, and, O, my stars!<br />
He pokes her head between the bars,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And melts off half her nose!</span><br />
<br />
Quite cross, a bit of string I beg,<br />
And tie it to his peg-top's peg,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And bang, with might and main,</span><br />
Its head against the parlor-door:<br />
Off flies the head, and hits the floor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And breaks a window-pane.</span><br />
<br />
This made him cry with rage and spite:<br />
Well, let him cry, it serves him right.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A pretty thing, forsooth!</span><br />
If he's to melt, all scalding hot,<br />
Half my doll's nose, and I am not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To draw his peg-top's tooth!</span><br />
<br />
Aunt Hannah heard the window break,<br />
And cried, "O naughty Nancy Lake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thus to distress your aunt:</span><br />
No Drury Lane for you to-day!"<br />
And while papa said, "Pooh, she may!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mamma said, "No, she sha'n't!"</span><br />
<br />
Well, after many a sad reproach,<br />
They got into a hackney-coach,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And trotted down the street.</span><br />
I saw them go: one horse was blind,<br />
The tails of both hung down behind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Their shoes were on their feet.</span><br />
<br />
The chaise in which poor brother Bill<br />
Used to be drawn to Pentonville,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Stood in the lumber-room:</span><br />
I wiped the dust from off the top,<br />
While Molly mopped it with a mop,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And brushed it with a broom.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg&nbsp;392]</a></span>

<br />
My uncle's porter, Samuel Hughes,<br />
Came in at six to black the shoes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(I always talk to Sam:)</span><br />
So what does he, but takes, and drags<br />
Me in the chaise along the flags,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And leaves me where I am.</span><br />
<br />
My father's walls are made of brick,<br />
But not so tall and not so thick<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As these; and, goodness me!</span><br />
My father's beams are made of wood,<br />
But never, never half so good<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As those that now I see.</span><br />
<br />
What a large floor! 'tis like a town!<br />
The carpet, when they lay it down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Won't hide it, I'll be bound;</span><br />
And there's a row of lamps!&mdash;my eye!<br />
How they do blaze! I wonder why<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They keep them on the ground.</span><br />
<br />
At first I caught hold of the wing,<br />
And kept away; but Mr. Thing-<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">umbob, the prompter man,</span><br />
Gave with his hand my chaise a shove,<br />
And said, "Go on, my pretty love;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Speak to 'em little Nan.</span><br />
<br />
"You've only got to curtsy, whisp-<br />
er, hold your chin up, laugh and lisp,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And then you're sure to take:</span><br />
I've known the day when brats, not quite<br />
Thirteen, got fifty pounds a night;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then why not Nancy Lake?"</span><br />
<br />
But while I'm speaking, where's papa?<br />
And where's my aunt? and where's mamma?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where's Jack? O there they sit!</span><br />
They smile, they nod; I'll go my ways,<br />
And order round poor Billy's chaise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To join them in the pit.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg&nbsp;393]</a></span>

<br />
And now, good gentlefolks, I go<br />
To join mamma, and see the show;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So, bidding you adieu,</span><br />
I curtsy like a pretty miss,<br />
And if you'll blow to me a kiss,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I'll blow a kiss to you.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">[Blows a kiss, and exit.]</span><br />

Side by side in the crowded streets,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amid its ebb and flow,</span><br />
We walked together one autumn morn;<br />

The markets blushed with fruits and flowers;<br />

You stopped and bought me at the stall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A spicy cantelope.</span><br />

We drained together its honeyed wine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We cast the seeds away;</span><br />
I slipped and fell on the moony rinds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And you took me home on a dray!</span><br />

The honeyed wine of your love is drained;<br />

The snow-flakes muffle the empty stall,<br />

The sky is an inkstand, upside down,<br />

<h3>POPULAR BALLAD: "NEVER FORGET YOUR
PARENTS"</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
A young man once was sitting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within a swell caf&eacute;,</span><br />
The music it was playing sweet&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The people was quite gay.</span><br />
But he alone was silent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A tear was in his eye&mdash;</span><br />
A waitress she stepped up to him, and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Asked him gently why.</span><br />
</p>
<div class='center'>(Change to Minor)</div>
<p>
He turned to her in sorrow and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At first he spoke no word,</span><br />
But soon he spoke unto her, for<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She was an honest girl.</span><br />
He rose up from the table<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that elegant caf&eacute;,</span><br />
And in a voice replete with tears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To her he then did say:</span><br />
</p>
<p class='h_5'>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Never forget your father,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Think all he done for you;</span><br />
A mother is a boy's best friend,<br />

If it were not for them, I'm sure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I might be quite forlorn;</span><br />
And if your parents had not have lived<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You would not have been born.</span><br />
<br />
A hush fell on the laughing throng,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It made them feel quite bad,</span><br />
For most of them was people, and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some parents they had had.</span><br />
Both men and ladies did shed tears.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The music it did cease,</span><br />
For all knew he had spoke the truth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By looking at his face.</span><br />

The waitress she wept bitterly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And others was in tears</span><br />
It made them think of the old home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They had not saw in years.</span><br />
And while their hearts was heavy and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their eyes they was quite red.</span><br />
This brave and honest boy again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To them these words he said:</span><br />

Never forget your father,<br />

<h3>HOW A GIRL WAS TOO RECKLESS OF GRAMMAR</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Matilda Maud Mackenzie frankly hadn't any chin,<br />
Her hands were rough, her feet she turned invariably in;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her general form was German,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By which I mean that you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her waist could not determine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Within a foot or two.</span><br />
And not only did she stammer,<br />
But she used the kind of grammar<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That is called, for sake of euphony, askew.</span><br />
<br />
From what I say about her, don't imagine I desire<br />
A prejudice against this worthy creature to inspire.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She was willing, she was active,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She was sober, she was kind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But she <i>never</i> looked attractive</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And she <i>hadn't</i> any mind.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg&nbsp;396]</a></span>
I knew her more than slightly,<br />
And I treated her politely<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I met her, but of course I wasn't blind!</span><br />
<br />
Matilda Maud Mackenzie had a habit that was droll,<br />
She spent her morning seated on a rock or on a knoll,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And threw with, much, composure</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A smallish rubber ball</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At an inoffensive osier</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By a little waterfall;</span><br />
But Matilda's way of throwing<br />
Was like other people's mowing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she never hit the willow-tree at all!</span><br />
<br />
One day as Miss Mackenzie with uncommon ardour tried<br />
To hit the mark, the missile flew exceptionally wide.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, before her eyes astounded,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On a fallen maple's trunk</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ricochetted and rebounded</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the rivulet, and sunk!</span><br />
Matilda, greatly frightened,<br />
In her grammar unenlightened,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remarked, "Well now I ast yer, who'd 'er thunk?"</span><br />
<br />
But what a marvel followed! From the pool at once there rose<br />
A frog, the sphere of rubber balanced deftly on his nose.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He beheld her fright and frenzy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, her panic to dispel,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On his knee by Miss Mackenzie</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He obsequiously fell.</span><br />
With quite as much decorum<br />
As a speaker in a forum<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He started in his history to tell.</span><br />
<br />
"Fair maid," he said, "I beg you do not hesitate or wince,<br />
If you'll promise that you'll wed me, I'll at once become a prince;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a fairy, old and vicious,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">An enchantment round me spun!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then he looked up, unsuspicious,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he saw what he had won,</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg&nbsp;397]</a></span>
And in terms of sad reproach, he<br />
Made some comments, <i>sotto voce</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Which the publishers have bidden me to shun!)</span><br />
<br />
Matilda Maud Mackenzie said, as if she meant to scold;<br />
"I <i>never</i>! Why, you forward thing! Now, ain't you awful bold!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just a glance he paused to give her,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And his head was seen to clutch,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then he darted to the river,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he dived to beat the Dutch!</span><br />
While the wrathful maiden panted<br />
"I don't think he was enchanted!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And he really didn't look it overmuch!)</span><br />

<h3>AN IDYLL OF PHATTE AND LEENE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
The hale John Sprat&mdash;oft called for shortness, Jack&mdash;<br />
Had married&mdash;had, in fact, a wife&mdash;and she<br />
Did worship him with wifely reverence.<br />
He, who had loved her when she was a girl,<br />
Compass'd her too, with sweet observances;<br />
E'en at the dinner table did it shine.<br />
For he&mdash;liking no fat himself&mdash;he never did,<br />
With jealous care piled up her plate with lean,<br />
Not knowing that all lean was hateful to her.<br />
And day by day she thought to tell him o't,<br />
And watched the fat go out with envious eye,<br />
But could not speak for bashful delicacy.<br />
<br />
At last it chanced that on a winter day,<br />
The beef&mdash;a prize joint!&mdash;little was but fat;<br />
So fat, that John had all his work cut out,<br />
To snip out lean fragments for his wife,<br />
Leaving, in very sooth, none for himself;<br />
Which seeing, she spoke courage to her soul,<br />
Took up her fork, and, pointing to the joint<br />
Where 'twas the fattest, piteously she said;<br />
"Oh, husband! full of love and tenderness!<br />
What is the cause that you so jealously<br />
Pick out the lean for me. I like it not!<br />
Nay, loathe it&mdash;'tis on the fat that I would feast;<br />
O me, I fear you do not like my taste!"<br />
<br />
Then he, dropping his horny-handled carving knife,<br />
Sprinkling therewith the gravy o'er her gown,<br />
Answer'd, amazed: "What! you like fat, my wife!<br />
And never told me. Oh, this is not kind!<br />
Think what your reticence has wrought for us;<br />
How all the fat sent down unto the maid&mdash;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg&nbsp;407]</a></span>

Who likes not fat&mdash;for such maids never do&mdash;<br />
Has been put in the waste-tub, sold for grease,<br />
And pocketed as servant's perquisite!<br />
Oh, wife! this news is good; for since, perforce,<br />
A joint must be not fat nor lean, but both;<br />
Our different tastes will serve our purpose well;<br />
For, while you eat the fat&mdash;the lean to me<br />
Falls as my cherished portion. Lo! 'tis good!"<br />
So henceforth&mdash;he that tells the tale relates&mdash;<br />
In John Sprat's household waste was quite unknown;<br />
For he the lean did eat, and she the fat,<br />
And thus the dinner-platter was all cleared.<br />

Made for mine ears a merry din,<br />
If I were the Sultan, and he were I,<br />
Here i' the grass he should loafing lie,<br />
And I should bestride my zebra steed,<br />
And ride to the hunt of the centipede:<br />
While the pet of the harem, Dandeline,<br />
Should fill me a crystal bucket of wine,<br />
And the kislar aga, Up-to-Snuff,<br />
Should wipe my mouth when I sighed, "Enough!"<br />
And the gay court poet, Fearfulbore,<br />
Should sit in the hall when the hunt was o'er,<br />
And chant me songs of silvery tone,<br />
Not from Hafiz, but&mdash;mine own!<br />

Ah, wee sweet love, beside me here,<br />

<h3>THE WILLOWS</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
The skies they were ashen and sober,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The streets they were dirty and drear;</span><br />
It was night in the month of October,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of my most immemorial year;</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg&nbsp;424]</a></span>

Like the skies I was perfectly sober,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As I stopped at the mansion of Shear,&mdash;</span><br />
At the "Nightingale,"&mdash;perfectly sober,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the willowy woodland, down here.</span><br />
<br />
Here once in an alley Titanic<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Ten-pins,&mdash;I roamed with my soul,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Ten-pins,&mdash;with Mary, my soul;</span><br />
They were days when my heart was volcanic,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And impelled me to frequently roll,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made me resistlessly roll,</span><br />
Till my ten-strikes created a panic<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the realms of the Boreal pole,</span><br />
Till my ten-strikes created a panic<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the monkey atop of his pole.</span><br />
<br />
I repeat, I was perfectly sober,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But my thoughts they were palsied and sear,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My thoughts were decidedly queer;</span><br />
For I knew not the month was October,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I marked not the night of the year;</span><br />
I forgot that sweet <i>mor&ccedil;eau</i> of Auber<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the band oft perform&egrave;d down here;</span><br />
And I mixed the sweet music of Auber<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the Nightingale's music by Shear.</span><br />
<br />
And now as the night was senescent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And star-dials pointed to morn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And car-drivers hinted of morn,</span><br />
At the end of the path a liquescent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bibulous lustre was born:</span><br />
'Twas made by the bar-keeper present,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who mix&egrave;d a duplicate horn,&mdash;</span><br />
His two hands describing a crescent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Distinct with a duplicate horn.</span><br />
<br />
And I said: "This looks perfectly regal;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For it's warm, and I know I feel dry,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am confident that I feel dry.</span><br />
We have come past the emeu and eagle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And watched the gay monkey on high;</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg&nbsp;425]</a></span>

<br />
Let us drink to the emeu and eagle,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the swan and the monkey on high&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the eagle and monkey on high;</span><br />
For this bar-keeper will not inveigle,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bully boy with the vitreous eye;</span><br />
He surely would never inveigle,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet youth with the crystalline eye."</span><br />
<br />
But Mary, uplifting her finger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said, "Sadly this bar I mistrust,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I fear that this bar does not trust.</span><br />
Oh, hasten! oh, let us not linger!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, fly!&mdash;let us fly&mdash;ere we must!"</span><br />
In terror she cried, letting sink her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Parasol till it trailed in the dust,&mdash;</span><br />
In agony sobbed, letting sink her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Parasol till it trailed in the dust,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till it sorrowfully trailed in the dust.</span><br />
<br />
Then I pacified Mary, and kissed her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tempted her into the room,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And conquer'd her scruples and gloom;</span><br />
And we passed to the end of the vista,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But were stopped by the warning of doom&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By some words that were warning of doom.</span><br />
And I said, "What is written, sweet sister,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the opposite end of the room?"</span><br />
She sobbed, as she answered, "All liquors<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Must be paid for ere leaving the room."</span><br />
<br />
Then my heart it grew ashen and sober,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the streets were deserted and drear&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For my pockets were empty and drear;</span><br />
And I cried, "It was surely October,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On this very night of last year,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I journeyed&mdash;I journeyed down here&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I brought a fair maiden down here,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On this night of all nights in the year.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah! to me that inscription is clear:</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg&nbsp;426]</a></span>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well I know now I'm perfectly sober,</span><br />
Why no longer they credit me here,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well I know now that music of Auber,</span><br />
And this Nightingale, kept by one Shear."<br />

I, Angelo, obese, black-garmented,<br />
Respectable, much in demand, well fed<br />
With mine own larder's dainties, where, indeed,<br />
Such cakes of myrrh or fine alyssum seed,<br />
Thin as a mallow-leaf, embrowned o' the top.<br />
Which, cracking, lets the ropy, trickling drop<br />
Of sweetness touch your tongue, or potted nests<br />
Which my recondite recipe invests<br />
With cold conglomerate tidbits&mdash;ah, the bill!<br />
(You say), but given it were mine to fill<br />
My chests, the case so put were yours, we'll say<br />
(This counter, here, your post, as mine to-day),<br />
And you've an eye to luxuries, what harm<br />
In smoothing down your palate with the charm<br />
Yourself concocted? There we issue take;<br />
And see! as thus across the rim I break<br />
This puffy paunch of glazed embroidered cake,<br />
So breaks, through use, the lust of watering chaps<br />
And craveth plainness: do I so? Perhaps;<br />
But that's my secret. Find me such a man<br />
As Lippo yonder, built upon the plan<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg&nbsp;429]</a></span>

Of heavy storage, double-navelled, fat<br />
From his own giblet's oils, an Ararat<br />
Uplift o'er water, sucking rosy draughts<br />
From Noah's vineyard,&mdash;crisp, enticing wafts<br />
Yon kitchen now emits, which to your sense<br />
Somewhat abate the fear of old events,<br />
Qualms to the stomach,&mdash;I, you see, am slow<br />
Unnecessary duties to forego,&mdash;<br />
You understand? A venison haunch, <i>haul gout</i>.<br />
Ducks that in Cimbrian olives mildly stew.<br />
And sprigs of anise, might one's teeth provoke<br />
To taste, and so we wear the complex yoke<br />
Just as it suits,&mdash;my liking, I confess,<br />
More to receive, and to partake no less,<br />
Still more obese, while through thick adipose<br />
Sensation shoots, from testing tongue to toes<br />
Far off, dim-conscious, at the body's verge,<br />
Where the froth-whispers of its waves emerge<br />
On the untasting sand. Stay, now! a seat<br />
Is bare: I, Angelo, will sit and eat.<br />

<h3>THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER</h3>

When I had firmly answered "No,"<br />
And he allowed that that was so,<br />

For good and all from Mr. B.,<br />

I said that it would be discreet<br />
That for awhile we should not meet;<br />
I promised that I would always feel<br />
A kindly interest in his weal;<br />
I thanked him for his amorous zeal;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In short, I said all I could but "yes."</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg&nbsp;432]</a></span>

<br />
I said what I'm accustomed to;<br />
I acted as I always do.<br />
I promised he should find in me<br />
A friend,&mdash;a sister, if that might be;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he was still dissatisfied.</span><br />
He certainly was most polite;<br />
He said exactly what was right,<br />
He acted very properly,<br />
Except indeed for this, that he<br />
Insisted on inviting me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To come with him for "one more last ride."</span><br />
<br />
A little while in doubt I stood:<br />
A ride, no doubt, would do me good;<br />
I had a habit and a hat<br />
Extremely well worth looking at;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The weather was distinctly fine.</span><br />
My horse, too, wanted exercise,<br />
And time, when one is riding, flies;<br />
Besides, it really seemed, you see,<br />
The only way of ridding me<br />
Of pertinacious Mr. B.;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So my head I graciously incline.</span><br />
<br />
I won't say much of what happened next;<br />
I own I was extremely vexed.<br />
Indeed I should have been aghast<br />
If any one had seen what passed;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But nobody need ever know</span><br />
That, as I leaned forward to stir the fire,<br />
He advanced before I could well retire;<br />
And I suddenly felt, to my great alarm,<br />
The grasp of a warm, unlicensed arm,<br />
An embrace in which I found no charm;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I was awfully glad when he let me go.</span><br />
<br />
Then we began to ride; my steed<br />
Was rather fresh, too fresh indeed,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg&nbsp;433]</a></span>

And at first I thought of little, save<br />
The way to escape an early grave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the dust rose up on either side.</span><br />
My stern companion jogged along<br />
On a brown old cob both broad and strong.<br />
He looked as he does when he's writing verse,<br />
Or endeavoring not to swear and curse,<br />
Or wondering Where he has left his purse;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Indeed it was a sombre ride.</span><br />
<br />
I spoke of the weather to Mr. B.,<br />
But he neither listened nor spoke to me.<br />
I praised his horse, and I smiled the smile<br />
Which was wont to move him once in a while.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I said I was wearing his favorite flowers,</span><br />
But I wasted my words on the desert air,<br />
For he rode with a fixed and gloomy stare.<br />
I wonder what he was thinking about.<br />
As I don't read verse, I shan't find out.<br />
It was something subtle and deep, no doubt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A theme to detain a man for hours.</span><br />
<br />
Ah! there was the corner where Mr. S.<br />
So nearly induced me to whisper "yes";<br />
And here it was that the next but one<br />
Proposed on horseback, or would have done,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had his horse not most opportunely shied;</span><br />
Which perhaps was due to the unseen flick<br />
He received from my whip; 'twas a scurvy trick,<br />
But I never could do with that young man,&mdash;<br />
I hope his present young woman can.<br />
Well, I must say, never, since time began,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did I go for a duller or longer ride.</span><br />
<br />
He never smiles and he never speaks;<br />
He might go on like this for weeks;<br />
He rolls a slightly frenzied eye<br />
Towards the blue and burning sky,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the cob bounds on with tireless stride.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg&nbsp;434]</a></span>

If we aren't home for lunch at two<br />
I don't know what papa will do;<br />
But I know full well he will say to me,<br />
"I never approved of Mr. B.;<br />
It's the very devil that you and he<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ride, ride together, forever ride."</span><br />

<p class='poem'>I have been reading Walt Whitman, and know not whether he be me, or me he;&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem'>O, chaos and everlasting bosh!</p>
<p class='poem'>I am a poet; I swear it! If you do not believe it you are a dolt, a fool, an idiot!</p>
<p class='poem'>Milton, Shakespere, Dante, Tommy Moore, Pope, never, but Byron, too, perhaps, and last, not least, Me, and the Poet Close.</p>
<p class='poem'>We send our resonance echoing down the adamantine ca&ntilde;ons of the future!</p>
<p class='poem'>We live forever! The worms who criticise us (asses!) laugh, scoff, jeer, and babble&mdash;die!</p>
<p class='poem'>Serve them right.</p>
<p class='poem'>What is the difference between Judy, the pride of Fleet Street, the glory of Shoe Lane, and Walt Whitman?</p>
<p class='poem'>Start not! 'Tis no end of a minstrel show who perpends this query;</p>
<p class='poem'>'Tis no brain-racking puzzle from an inner page of the Family Herald,</p>
<p class='poem'>No charade, acrostic (double or single), conundrum, riddle, rebus, anagram, or other guess-work.</p>
<p class='poem'>I answer thus: We both write truths&mdash;great, stern, solemn, unquenchable truths&mdash;couched in more or less ridiculous language.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg&nbsp;435]</a></span>

<p class='poem'>I, as a rule use rhyme, he does not; therefore, I am his Superior (which is also a lake in his great and glorious country).</p>
<p class='poem'>I scorn, with the unutterable scorn of the despiser of pettiness, to take a mean advantage of him.</p>
<p class='poem'>He writes, he sells, he is read (more or less); why then should I rack my brains and my rhyming dictionary? I will see the public hanged first!</p>
<p class='poem'>I sing of America, of the United States, of the stars and stripes of Oskhosh, of Kalamazoo, and of Salt Lake City.</p>
<p class='poem'>I sing of the railroad cars, of the hotels, of the breakfasts, the lunches, the dinners, and the suppers;</p>
<p class='poem'>Of the soup, the fish, the entr&eacute;es, the joints, the game, the puddings and the ice-cream.</p>
<p class='poem'>I sing all&mdash;I eat all&mdash;I sing in turn of Dr. Bluffem's Anti-bilious Pills.</p>
<p class='poem'>No subject is too small, too insignificant, for Nature's poet.</p>
<p class='poem'>I sing of the cocktail, a new song for every cocktail, hundreds of songs, hundreds of cocktails.</p>
<p class='poem'>It is a great and a glorious land! The Mississippi, the Missouri, and a million other torrents roll their waters to the ocean.</p>
<p class='poem'>It is a great and glorious land! The Alleghanies, the Catskills, the Rockies (see atlas for other mountain ranges too numerous to mention) pierce the clouds!</p>
<p class='poem'>And the greatest and most glorious product of this great and glorious land is Walt Whitman;</p>
<p class='poem'>This must be so, for he says it himself.</p>
<p class='poem'>There is but one greater than he between the rising and the setting sun.</p>
<p class='poem'>There is but one before whom he meekly bows his humbled head.</p>
<p class='poem'>Oh, great and glorious land, teeming producer of all things, creator of Niagara, and inventor of Walt Whitman,</p>
<p class='poem'>Erase your national advertisements of liver pads and cures for rheumatism from your public monuments, and inscribe thereon in letters of gold the name <i>Judy</i>.</p>

<h3>THE DECLARATION</h3>

Twas late, and the gay company was gone,<br />
And light lay soft on the deserted room<br />
From alabaster vases, and a scent<br />
Of orange-leaves, and sweet verbena came<br />
Through the unshutter'd window on the air.<br />
And the rich pictures with their dark old tints<br />
Hung like a twilight landscape, and all things<br />
Seem'd hush'd into a slumber. Isabel,<br />
The dark-eyed, spiritual Isabel<br />
Was leaning on her harp, and I had stay'd<br />
To whisper what I could not when the crowd<br />
Hung on her look like worshipers. I knelt,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg&nbsp;447]</a></span>

<br />
And with the fervor of a lip unused<br />
To the cool breath of reason, told my love.<br />
There was no answer, and I took the hand<br />
That rested on the strings, and press'd a kiss<br />
Upon it unforbidden&mdash;and again<br />
Besought her, that this silent evidence<br />
That I was not indifferent to her heart,<br />
Might have the seal of one sweet syllable.<br />
I kiss'd the small white fingers as I spoke,<br />
And she withdrew them gently, and upraised<br />
Her forehead from its resting-place, and look'd<br />
Earnestly on me&mdash;<i>She had been asleep!</i><br />

<h3>HE CAME TO PAY</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
The editor sat with his head in his hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his elbows at rest on his knees;</span><br />
He was tired of the ever-increasing demands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On his time, and he panted for ease.</span><br />
The clamor for copy was scorned with a sneer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he sighed in the lowest of tones:</span><br />
"Won't somebody come with a dollar to cheer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The heart of Emanuel Jones?"</span><br />
<br />
Just then on the stairway a footstep was heard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a rap-a-tap loud at the door,</span><br />
And the flickering hope that had been long deferred<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blazed up like a beacon once more;</span><br />
And there entered a man with a cynical smile<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That was fringed with a stubble of red,</span><br />
Who remarked, as he tilted a sorry old tile<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the back of an average head:</span><br />
<br />
"I have come here to pay"&mdash;Here the editor cried:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You're as welcome as flowers in spring!</span><br />
Sit down in this easy armchair by my side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And excuse me awhile till I bring</span><br />

A lemonade dashed with a little old wine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a dozen cigars of the best....</span><br />
Ah! Here we are! This, I assure you, is fine;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Help yourself, most desirable guest."</span><br />
<br />
The visitor drank with a relish, and smoked<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till his face wore a satisfied glow,</span><br />
And the editor, beaming with merriment, joked<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a joyous, spontaneous flow;</span><br />
And then, when the stock of refreshments was gone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His guest took occasion to say,</span><br />
In accents distorted somewhat by a yawn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"My errand up here is to pay&mdash;"</span><br />
<br />
But the generous scribe, with a wave of his hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Put a stop to the speech of his guest,</span><br />
And brought in a melon, the finest the land<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ever bore on its generous breast;</span><br />
And the visitor, wearing a singular grin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seized the heaviest half of the fruit,</span><br />
And the juice, as it ran in a stream from his chin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Washed the mud of the pike from his boot.</span><br />
<br />
Then, mopping his face on a favorite sheet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which the scribe had laid carefully by,</span><br />
The visitor lazily rose to his feet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the dreariest kind of a sigh,</span><br />
And he said, as the editor sought his address,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In his books to discover his due:</span><br />
"I came here to pay&mdash;my respects to the press,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to borrow a dollar of you!"</span><br />

<h3>A FRAGMENT</h3>

<p>
His eye was stern and wild&mdash;his cheek was pale and cold as clay;<br />
Upon his tightened lip a smile of fearful meaning lay.<br />
He mused awhile&mdash;but not in doubt&mdash;no trace of doubt was there;<br />
It was the steady solemn pause of resolute despair.<br />
Once more he looked upon the scroll&mdash;once more its words he read&mdash;<br />
Then calmly, with unflinching hand, its folds before him spread.<br />
I saw him bare his throat, and seize the blue-cold gleaming steel,<br />
And grimly try the tempered edge he was so soon to feel!<br />
A sickness crept upon my heart, and dizzy swam my head&mdash;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg&nbsp;451]</a></span>

I could not stir&mdash;I could not cry&mdash;I felt benumbed and dead;<br />
Black icy horrors struck me dumb, and froze my senses o'er;<br />
I closed my eyes in utter fear, and strove to think no more.<br />
<br />
Again I looked: a fearful change across his face had passed&mdash;<br />
He seemed to rave&mdash;on cheek and lip a flaky foam was cast;<br />
He raised on high the glittering blade&mdash;then first I found a tongue&mdash;<br />
"Hold, madman! stay thy frantic deed!" I cried, and forth I sprung;<br />
He heard me, but he heeded not; one glance around he gave,<br />
And ere I could arrest his hands, he had&mdash;begun to <i>shave</i>!<br />

<h3>THE BITER BIT</h3>

<p>
The sun is in the sky, mother, the flowers are springing fair,<br />
And the melody of woodland birds is stirring in the air;<br />
The river, smiling to the sky, glides onward to the sea,<br />
And happiness is everywhere, oh, mother, but with me!<br />
<br />
They are going to the church, mother&mdash;I hear the marriage bell<br />
It booms along the upland&mdash;oh! it haunts me like a knell;<br />
He leads her on his arm, mother, he cheers her faltering step,<br />
And closely to his side she clings&mdash;she does, the demirep!<br />
<br />
They are crossing by the stile, mother, where we so oft have stood,<br />
The stile beside the shady thorn, at the corner of the wood;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg&nbsp;452]</a></span>

And the boughs, that wont to murmur back the words that won my ear,<br />
Wave their silver branches o'er him, as he leads his bridal fere.<br />
<br />
He will pass beside the stream, mother, where first my hand he pressed,<br />
By the meadow where, with quivering lip, his passion he confessed;<br />
And down the hedgerows where we've strayed again and yet again;<br />
But he will not think of me, mother, his broken-hearted Jane!<br />
<br />
He said that I was proud, mother, that I looked for rank and gold,<br />
He said I did not love him&mdash;he said my words were cold;<br />
He said I kept him off and on, in hopes of higher game&mdash;<br />
And it may be that I did, mother; but who hasn't done the same.<br />
<br />
I did not know my heart, mother&mdash;I know it now too late;<br />
I thought that I without a pang could wed some nobler mate;<br />
But no nobler suitor sought me&mdash;and he has taken wing,<br />
And my heart is gone, and I am left a lone and blighted thing.<br />
<br />
You may lay me in my bed, mother&mdash;my head is throbbing sore;<br />
And, mother, prithee, let the sheets be duly aired before;<br />
And, if you'd please, my mother dear, your poor desponding child,<br />
Draw me a pot of beer, mother, and, mother, draw it mild!<br />

Let all this room, these walls dissolve away,<br />
And bring me Surrey's fields to take their place:<br />
This floor be grass, and draughts as breezes play;<br />
Yon curtains trees, to wave in summer's face;<br />
My ceiling, sky; my water-jug a stream;<br />
My bed, a bank, on which to muse and dream.<br />
The spell is wrought: imagination swells<br />
My sleeping-room to hills, and woods, and dells!<br />
I walk abroad, for naught my footsteps hinder,<br />
And fling my arms. Oh! mi! I've broke the <i>winder</i>!<br />

<p>
One, who is not, we see; but one, whom we see not, is;<br />
Surely, this is not that; but that is assuredly this.<br />
<br />
What, and wherefore, and whence: for under is over and under;<br />
If thunder could be without lightning, lightning could be without thunder.<br />
<br />
Doubt is faith in the main; but faith, on the whole, is doubt;<br />
We cannot believe by proof; but could we believe without?<br />
<br />
Why, and whither, and how? for barley and rye are not clover;<br />
Neither are straight lines curves; yet over is under and over.<br />
<br />
One and two are not one; but one and nothing is two;<br />
Truth can hardly be false, if falsehood cannot be true.<br />
<br />
Parallels all things are; yet many of these are askew;<br />
You are certainly I; but certainly I am not you.<br />

One, whom we see not, is; and one, who is not, we see;<br />
Fiddle, we know, is diddle; and diddle, we take it, is dee.<br />

<h3>NEPHELIDIA</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p class='poem'>From the depth of the dreamy decline of the dawn through a notable nimbus of nebulous moonshine,</p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pallid and pink as the palm of the flag-flower that flickers with fear of the flies as they float,</span></p>
<p class='poem'>Are they looks of our lovers that lustrously lean from a marvel of mystic miraculous moonshine,</p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 1em;">These that we feel in the blood of our blushes that thicken and threaten with throbs through the throat?</span></p>
<p class='poem'>Thicken and thrill as a theatre thronged at appeal of an actor's appalled agitation,</p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fainter with fear of the fires of the future than pale with the promise of pride in the past;</span></p>
<p class='poem'>Flushed with the famishing fulness of fever that reddens with radiance of rathe recreation,</p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gaunt as the ghastliest of glimpses that gleam through the gloom of the gloaming when ghosts go aghast?</span></p>
<p class='poem'>Nay, for the nick of the tick of the time is a tremulous touch on the temples of terror,</p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Strained as the sinews yet strenuous with strife of the dead who is dumb as the dust-heaps of death;</span></p>
<p class='poem'>Surely no soul is it, sweet as the spasm of erotic emotional exquisite error,</p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bathed in the balms of beatified bliss, beatific itself by beatitude's breath.</span></p>
<p class='poem'>Surely no spirit or sense of a soul that was soft to the spirit and soul of our senses</p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweetens the stress of surprising suspicion that sobs in the semblance and sound of a sigh;</span></p>
<p class='poem'>Only this oracle opens Olympian, in mystical moods and triangular tenses,&mdash;</p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Life is the lust of a lamp for the light that is dark till the dawn of the day when we die."</span></p>
<p class='poem'>Mild is the mirk and monotonous music of memory, melodiously mute as it may be,</p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the hope in the heart of a hero is bruised by the breach of men's rapiers, resigned to the rod;</span></p>
<p class='poem'>Made meek as a mother whose bosom-beats bound with the bliss-bringing bulk of a balm-breathing baby,</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg&nbsp;460]</a></span>

<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 1em;">As they grope through the grave-yard of creeds, under skies growing green at a groan for the grimness of God.</span></p>
<p class='poem'>Blank is the book of his bounty beholden of old, and its binding is blacker than bluer:</p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of blue into black is the scheme of the skies, and their dews are the wine of the bloodshed of things:</span></p>
<p class='poem'>Till the darkling desire of delight shall be free as a fawn that is freed from the fangs that pursue her,</p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the heart-beats of hell shall be hushed by a hymn from the hunt that has harried the kennel of kings.</span></p>

<h3>THE COCK AND THE BULL</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
You see this pebble-stone? It's a thing I bought<br />
Of a bit of a chit of a boy i' the mid o' the day&mdash;<br />
I like to dock the smaller parts-o'-speech,<br />
As we curtail the already cur-tailed cur<br />
(You catch the paronomasia, play 'po' words?)<br />
Did, rather, i' the pre-Landseerian days.<br />
Well, to my muttons. I purchased the concern,<br />
And clapt it i' my poke, having given for same<br />
By way o' chop, swop, barter or exchange&mdash;<br />
"Chop" was my snickering dandiprat's own term&mdash;<br />
One shilling and fourpence, current coin o' the realm.<br />
O-n-e one and f-o-u-r four<br />
Pence, one and fourpence&mdash;you are with me, sir?&mdash;<br />
What hour it skills not: ten or eleven o' the clock,<br />
One day (and what a roaring day it was<br />
Go shop or sight-see&mdash;bar a spit o' rain!)<br />
In February, eighteen sixty nine,<br />
Alexandrina Victoria, Fidei,<br />
Hm&mdash;hm&mdash;how runs the jargon? being on the throne.<br />
<br />
Such, sir, are all the facts, succinctly put,<br />
The basis or substratum&mdash;what you will&mdash;<br />
Of the impending eighty thousand lines.<br />
"Not much in 'em either," quoth perhaps simple Hodge.<br />
But there's a superstructure. Wait a bit.<br />
<br />
Mark first the rationale of the thing:<br />
Hear logic rivel and levigate the deed.<br />
That shilling&mdash;and for matter o' that, the pence&mdash;<br />
I had o' course upo' me&mdash;wi' me say&mdash;<br />
(<i>Mecum's</i> the Latin, make a note o' that)<br />
When I popp'd pen i' stand, scratched ear, wiped snout,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg&nbsp;465]</a></span>

<br />
(Let everybody wipe his own himself)<br />
Sniff'd&mdash;tch!&mdash;at snuffbox; tumbled up, he-heed,<br />
Haw-haw'd (not he-haw'd, that's another guess thing):<br />
Then fumbled at, and stumbled out of, door,<br />
I shoved the timber ope wi' my omoplat;<br />
And <i>in vestibulo</i>, i' the lobby to-wit,<br />
(Iacobi Facciolati's rendering, sir,)<br />
Donned galligaskins, antigropeloes,<br />
And so forth; and, complete with hat and gloves,<br />
One on and one a-dangle i' in my hand,<br />
And ombrifuge (Lord love you!) cas o' rain,<br />
I flopped forth, 'sbuddikins! on my own ten toes,<br />
(I do assure you there be ten of them)<br />
And went clump-clumping up hill and down dale<br />
To find myself o' the sudden i' front o' the boy.<br />
Put case I hadn't 'em on me, could I ha' bought<br />
This sort-o'-kind-o'-what-you-might-call-toy,<br />
This pebble-thing, o' the boy-thing? Q. E. D.<br />
That's proven without aid for mumping Pope,<br />
Sleek porporate or bloated cardinal.<br />
(Isn't it, old Fatchops? You're in Euclid now.)<br />
So, having the shilling&mdash;having i' fact a lot&mdash;<br />
And pence and halfpence, ever so many o' them,<br />
I purchased, as I think I said before,<br />
The pebble (<i>lapis</i>, <i>lapidis</i>, <i>di</i>, <i>dem</i>, <i>de</i>&mdash;<br />
What nouns 'crease short i' the genitive, Fatchops, eh?)<br />
O, the boy, a bare-legg'd beggarly son of a gun,<br />
For one-and-fourpence. Here we are again.<br />
Now Law steps in, bewigged, voluminous-jaw'd;<br />
Investigates and re-investigates.<br />
Was the transaction illegal? Law shakes head.<br />
Perpend, sir, all the bearings of the case.<br />
<br />
At first the coin was mine, the chattel his.<br />
But now (by virtue of the said exchange<br />
And barter) <i>vice versa</i> all the coin,<br />
<i>Rer juris operationem</i>, vests<br />
I' the boy and his assigns till ding o' doom;<br />
<i>In s&aelig;cula s&aelig;culo-o-orum</i>;<br />
(I think I hear the Abate mouth out that.)<br />
To have and hold the same to him and them ...<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg&nbsp;466]</a></span>

Confer some idiot on Conveyancing.<br />
Whereas the pebble and every part thereof,<br />
And all that appertaineth thereunto,<br />
<i>Quodcunque pertinet ad em rem</i>,<br />
(I fancy, sir, my Latin's rather pat)<br />
Or shall, will, may, might, can, could, would, or should,<br />
<i>Subaudi c&aelig;tera</i>&mdash;clap we to the close&mdash;<br />
For what's the good of law in such a case o' the kind<br />
Is mine to all intents and purposes.<br />
This settled, I resume the thread o' the tale.<br />
<br />
Now for a touch o' the vendor's quality.<br />
He says a gen'lman bought a pebble of him,<br />
(This pebble i' sooth, sir, which I hold i' my hand)&mdash;<br />
And paid for 't, <i>like</i> a gen'lman, on the nail.<br />
"Did I o'ercharge him a ha'penny? Devil a bit.<br />
Fiddlepin's end! Get out, you blazing ass!<br />
Gabble o' the goose. Don't bugaboo-baby <i>me</i>!<br />
Go double or quits? Yah! tittup! what's the odds?"<br />
&mdash;There's the transaction viewed in the vendor's light.<br />
<br />
Next ask that dumpled hag, stood snuffling by,<br />
With her three frowsy blowsy brats o' babes,<br />
The scum o' the Kennel, cream o' the filth-heap&mdash;Faugh!<br />
Aie, aie, aie, aie! [Greek: otototototoi],<br />
('Stead which we blurt out, Hoighty toighty now)&mdash;<br />
And the baker and candlestick maker, and Jack and Gill.<br />
Blear'd Goody this and queasy Gaffer that,<br />
Ask the Schoolmaster, Take Schoolmaster first.<br />
He saw a gentleman purchase of a lad<br />
A stone, and pay for it <i>rite</i> on the square,<br />
And carry it off <i>per saltum</i>, jauntily<br />
<i>Propria qu&aelig; maribus</i>, gentleman's property now<br />
(Agreeable to the law explained above).<br />
<i>In proprium usum</i>, for his private ends,<br />
The boy he chucked a brown i' the air, and bit<br />
I' the face the shilling; heaved a thumping stone<br />
At a lean hen that ran cluck-clucking by,<br />
(And hit her, dead as nail i' post o' door,)<br />
Then <i>abiit</i>&mdash;What's the Ciceronian phrase?<br />
<i>Excessit</i>, <i>evasit</i>, <i>erupit</i>&mdash;off slogs boy;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg&nbsp;467]</a></span>

<br />
Off like bird, <i>avi similis</i>&mdash;(you observed<br />
The dative? Pretty i' the Mantuan!)&mdash;<i>Anglice</i><br />
Off in three flea skips. <i>Hactenus</i>, so far,<br />
So good, <i>tam bene. Bene, satis, male</i>,&mdash;<br />
Where was I with my trope 'bout one in a quag?<br />
I did once hitch the Syntax into verse<br />
<i>Verbum personale</i>, a verb personal,<br />
<i>Concordat</i>&mdash;ay, "agrees," old Fatchops&mdash;<i>cum</i><br />
<i>Nominativo</i>, with its nominative,<br />
<i>Genere</i>, i' point of gender, <i>numero</i>,<br />
O' number, <i>et persona</i>, and person. <i>Ut</i>,<br />
Instance: <i>Sol ruit</i>, down flops sun, <i>et</i> and,<br />
<i>Montes umbrantur</i>, out flounce mountains. Pah!<br />
Excuse me, sir, I think I'm going mad.<br />
<br />
You see the trick on't, though, and can yourself<br />
Continue the discourse <i>ad libitum</i>.<br />
It takes up about eighty thousand lines,<br />
A thing imagination boggles at;<br />
And might, odds-bobs, sir! in judicious hands<br />
Extend from here to Mesopotamy.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My fondest hopes would not decay;</span><br />
I never loved a tree or flower<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which was the first to fade away!</span><br />
The garden, where I used to delve<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Short-frock'd, still yields me pinks in plenty;</span><br />
The pear-tree that I climbed at twelve<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I see still blossoming, at twenty.</span><br />
<br />
I never nursed a dear gazelle;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I was given a parroquet&mdash;</span><br />
(How I did nurse him if unwell!)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's imbecile, but lingers yet.</span><br />
He's green, with an enchanting tuft;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He melts me with his small black eye;</span><br />
He'd look inimitable stuffed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And knows it&mdash;but he will not die!</span><br />
<br />
I had a kitten&mdash;I was rich<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In pets&mdash;but all too soon my kitten</span><br />
Became a full-sized cat, by which<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've more than once been scratched and bitten</span><br />
And when for sleep her limbs she curl'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One day beside her untouch'd plateful,</span><br />
And glided calmly from the world,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I freely own that I was grateful.</span><br />
<br />
And then I bought a dog&mdash;a queen!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, Tiny, dear departing pug!</span><br />
She lives, but she is past sixteen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scarce can crawl across the rug.</span><br />
I loved her beautiful and kind;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Delighted in her pert bow-wow;</span><br />
But now she snaps if you don't mind;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twere lunacy to love her now.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg&nbsp;470]</a></span>

<br />
I used to think, should e'er mishap<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Betide my crumple-visaged Ti,</span><br />
In shape of prowling thief, or trap,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or coarse bull-terrier&mdash;I should die.</span><br />
But ah! disasters have their use,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And life might e'en be too sunshiny;</span><br />
Nor would I make myself a goose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If some big dog should swallow Tiny.</span><br />

<h3>WORDSWORTHIAN REMINISCENCE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
I walked and came upon a picket fence,<br />
And every picket went straight up and down,<br />
And all at even intervals were placed,<br />
All painted green, all pointed at the top,<br />
And every one inextricably nailed<br />
Unto two several cross-beams, which did go,<br />
Not as the pickets, but quite otherwise,<br />
And they two crossed, but back of all were posts.<br />
<br />
O beauteous picket fence, can I not draw<br />
Instruction from thee? Yea, for thou dost teach,<br />
That even as the pickets are made fast<br />
To that which seems all at cross purposes,<br />
So are our human lives, to the Divine,<br />
But, oh! not purposeless, for even as they<br />
Do keep stray cows from trespass, we, no doubt,<br />
Together guard some plan of Deity.<br />
<br />
Thus did I moralise. And from the beams<br />
And pickets drew a lesson to myself,&mdash;<br />
But where the posts came in, I could not tell.<br />

As each of the seven puts its fist in<br />

Wherefore thou art not wrong,<br />

Fiddlestrings uncommon strong;<br />
To thee the fiddlestrings belong<br />

<h4>RELATES THE DEATH OF THE TIRED MAN</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
There were two of us left in the berry-patch;<br />
Bryan O'Lin and Jack had gone to Norwich.&mdash;<br />
They called him Jack a' Nory, half in fun<br />
And half because it seemed to anger him.&mdash;<br />
So there we stood and let the berries go,<br />
Talking of men we knew and had forgotten.<br />
A sprawling, humpbacked mountain frowned on us<br />
And blotted out a smouldering sunset cloud<br />
That broke in fiery ashes. "Well," he said,<br />
"Old Adam Brown is dead and gone; you'll never<br />
See him any more. He used to wear<br />
A long, brown coat that buttoned down before.<br />
That's all I ever knew of him; I guess that's all<br />
That anyone remembers. Eh?" he said,<br />
And then, without a pause to let me answer,<br />
He went right on.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"How about Dr. Foster?"</span><br />
"Well, how <i>about</i> him?" I managed to reply.<br />
He glared at me for having interrupted.<br />
And stopped to pick his words before he spoke;<br />
Like one who turns all personal remarks<br />
Into a general survey of the world.<br />
Choosing his phrases with a finicky care<br />
So they might fit some vague opinions,<br />
Taken, third-hand, from last year's <i>New York Times</i><br />
And jumbled all together into a thing<br />
He thought was his philosophy.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Never mind;</span><br />
There's more in Foster than you'd understand.<br />
But," he continued, darkly as before,<br />
"What do you make of Solomon Grundy's case?<br />
You know the gossip when he first came here.<br />
Folks said he'd gone to smash in Lunenburg,<br />
And four years in the State Asylum here<br />
Had almost finished him. It was Sanders' job<br />
That put new life in him. A clear, cool day;<br />
The second Monday in July it was.<br />

'Born on a Monday,' that is what they said.<br />
Remember the next few days? I guess you don't;<br />
That was before your time. Well, Tuesday night<br />
He said he'd go to church; and just before the prayer<br />
He blurts right out, 'I've come here to get christened.<br />
If I am going to have a brand new life<br />
I'll have a new name, too.' Well, sure enough<br />
They christened him, though I've forgotten what;<br />
And Etta Stark, (you know, the pastor's girl)<br />
Her head upset by what she called romance,<br />
She went and married him on Wednesday noon.<br />
Thursday the sun or something in the air<br />
Got in his blood and right off he took sick.<br />
Friday the thing got worse, and so did he;<br />
And Saturday at four o'clock he died.<br />
Buried on Sunday with the town decked out<br />
As if it was a circus-day. And not a soul<br />
Knew why they went or what he meant to them<br />
Or what he died of. What would be <i>your</i> guess?"<br />
"Well," I replied, "it seems to me that he,<br />
Just coming from a sedentary life,<br />
Felt a great wave of energy released,<br />
And tried to crowd too much in one short week.<br />
The laws of physics teach&mdash;"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"No, not at all.</span><br />

<h4>ESTABLISHES THE "ENTENTE CORDIALE" BY RECITING "THE
SINGULAR STUPIDITY OF J. SPRATT, ESQ.," IN THE MANNER OF
GUY WETMORE CARRYL.</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Of all the mismated pairs ever created<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The worst of the lot were the Spratts.</span><br />
Their life was a series of quibbles and queries<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And quarrels and squabbles and spats.</span><br />
They argued at breakfast, they argued at tea,<br />
And they argued from midnight to quarter past three.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg&nbsp;481]</a></span>

<br />
The family Spratt-head was rather a fat-head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a bellicose body to boot.</span><br />
He was selfish and priggish and worse, he was piggish&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A regular beast of a brute.</span><br />
At table his acts were incredibly mean;<br />
He gave his wife fat&mdash;and <i>he</i> gobbled the lean!<br />
<br />
What's more, she was censured whenever she ventured<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To dare to object to her fare;</span><br />
He said "It ain't tasteful, but we can't be wasteful;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And <i>someone</i> must eat what is there!"</span><br />
But his coarseness exceeded all bounds of control<br />
When he laughed at her Art and the State of her Soul.<br />
<br />
So what with his jeering and fleering and sneering,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He plagued her from dawn until dark.</span><br />
He bellowed "I'll teach ye to read Shaw and Nietzsche"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he was as bad as his bark.</span><br />
"The place for a woman&mdash;&mdash;" he'd start, very glib....<br />
And so on, for two or three hours <i>ad lib</i>.<br />
<br />
So very malignant became his indignant<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remarks about "Culture" and "Cranks,"</span><br />
That at last she revolted. She up and she bolted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And entered the militant ranks....</span><br />
When she died, after breaking nine-tenths of the laws,<br />
She left all her money and jewels to the Cause!<br />
<br />
And <i>THE MORAL</i> is this (though a bit abstruse):<br />
What's sauce for a more or less proper goose,<br />
When it rouses the violent, feminine dander,<br />
Is apt to be sauce for the propaganda.<br />

<h3>BALLAD OF THE CANAL</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
We were crowded in the cabin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not a soul had room to sleep;</span><br />
It was midnight on the waters,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the banks were very steep.</span><br />
<br />
'Tis a fearful thing when sleeping,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To be startled by the shock,</span><br />
And to hear the rattling trumpet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thunder, "Coming to a lock!"</span><br />
<br />
So we shuddered there in silence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the stoutest berth was shook,</span><br />
While the wooden gates were opened<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the mate talked with the cook.</span><br />
<br />
And as thus we lay in darkness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each one wishing we were there,</span><br />
"We are through!" the captain shouted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he sat down on a chair.</span><br />
<br />
And his little daughter whispered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thinking that he ought to know,</span><br />
"Isn't travelling by canal-boats<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just as safe as it is slow?"</span><br />
<br />
Then he kissed the little maiden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with better cheer we spoke,</span><br />
And we trotted into Pittsburg,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the morn looked through the smoke.</span><br />

<h3>THERE'S A BOWER OF BEAN-VINES</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
There's a bower of bean-vines in Benjamin's yard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the cabbages grow round it, planted for greens;</span><br />
In the time of my childhood 'twas terribly hard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To bend down the bean-poles, and pick off the beans.</span><br />
<br />
That bower and its products I never forget,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But oft, when my landlady presses me hard,</span><br />
I think, are the cabbages growing there yet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are the bean-vines still bearing in Benjamin's yard?</span><br />
<br />
No, the bean-vines soon withered that once used to wave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But some beans had been gathered, the last that hung on;</span><br />
And a soup was distilled in a kettle, that gave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All the fragrance of summer when summer was gone.</span><br />
<br />
Thus memory draws from delight, ere it dies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An essence that breathes of it awfully hard;</span><br />
As thus good to my taste as 'twas then to my eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is that bower of bean-vines in Benjamin's yard.</span><br />

And I'll give thee a silver dime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To row us o'er the ferry."</span><br />
<br />
"Now, who would cross the Ohio,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This dark and stormy water?"</span><br />
"O, I am this young lady's beau,<br />

And should he find us here to-night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd lose my reputation.</span><br />
<br />
"They've missed the girl and purse beside,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His horsemen hard have pressed me;</span><br />
And who will cheer my bonny bride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If yet they shall arrest me?"</span><br />
<br />
Out spoke the boatman then in time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You shall not fail, don't fear it;</span><br />
I'll go, not for your silver dime,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But for your manly spirit.</span><br />
<br />
"And by my word, the bonny bird<br />

For though a storm is coming on,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll row you o'er the ferry."</span><br />

By this the wind more fiercely rose,<br />

But still, as wilder rose the wind,<br />

As hath the seeded thistle, when a parle<br />
It holds with Zephyr, ere it sendeth fair<br />
Its light balloons into the summer air;<br />
Thereto his beard had not begun to bloom.<br />
No brush had touched his cheek, or razor sheer;<br />
No care had touched his cheek with mortal doom,<br />
But new he was and bright, as scarf from Persian loom.<br />
<br />
Ne car&egrave;d he for wine, or half and half;<br />
Ne car&egrave;d he for fish, or flesh, or fowl;<br />
And sauces held he worthless as the chaff;<br />
He 'sdeigned the swine-head at the wassail-bowl:<br />
Ne with lewd ribbalds sat he cheek by jowl;<br />
Ne with sly lemans in the scorner's chair;<br />
But after water-brooks this pilgrim's soul<br />
Panted and all his food was woodland air;<br />

By many a damsel brave and rouge of cheek;<br />
Nor did he know each aged watchman's beat,<br />

For curl&egrave;d Jewesses, with ankles neat,<br />
Who, as they walk abroad, make tinkling with their feet.<br />

<h3>ANNABEL LEE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
'Twas more than a million years ago,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or so it seems to me,</span><br />
That I used to prance around and beau<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The beautiful Annabel Lee.</span><br />
There were other girls in the neighborhood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But none was a patch to she.</span><br />
<br />
And this was the reason that long ago,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My love fell out of a tree,</span><br />
And busted herself on a cruel rock;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A solemn sight to see,</span><br />
For it spoiled the hat and gown and looks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.</span><br />
<br />
We loved with a love that was lovely love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I and my Annabel Lee,</span><br />
And we went one day to gather the nuts<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That men call hickoree.</span><br />
And I stayed below in the rosy glow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While she shinned up the tree,</span><br />
But no sooner up than down kerslup<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came the beautiful Annabel Lee.</span><br />
<br />
And the pallid moon and the hectic noon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bring gleams of dreams for me,</span><br />
Of the desolate and desperate fate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg&nbsp;498]</a></span>

<br />
And I often think as I sink on the brink<br />
Of slumber's sea, of the warm pink link<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That bound my soul to Annabel Lee;</span><br />
And it wasn't just best for her interest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To climb that hickory tree,</span><br />
For had she stayed below with me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We'd had no hickory nuts maybe,</span><br />
But I should have had my Annabel Lee.<br />

<p class='poem'>You want to see Paris, to eat truffles, to have a good time; in Vienna, London, Florence, Monaco, to have a good time; you want to see Venice.</p>
<p class='poem'>Come with me. I will give you a good time; I will give you all the Venice you want, and most of the Paris.</p>
<p class='poem'>I, Walt, I call to you. I am all on deck! Come and loafe with me! Let me tote you around by your elbow and show you things.</p>

<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>1. The brown-stone house; the father coming home worried
from a bad day's business; the wife meets him in the
marble pav'd vestibule; she throws her arms about
him; she presses him close to her; she looks him full
in the face with affectionate eyes; the frown from his
brow disappearing.
<br />
Darling, she says, Johnny has fallen down and cut his
head; the cook is going away, and the boiler leaks.
</p>
<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>2. The mechanic's dark little third-story room, seen in a
flash from the Elevated Railway train; the sewing-machine
in a corner; the small cook-stove; the whole
family eating cabbage around a kerosene lamp; of the
clatter and roar and groaning wail of the Elevated
train unconscious; of the smell of the cabbage unconscious.
<br />
Me, passant, in the train, of the cabbage not quite so
unconscious.
</p>
<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>3. The French Flat; the small rooms, all right-angles, un-individual;
the narrow halls; the gaudy, cheap decorations
everywhere.
</p>
<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>The janitor and the cook exchanging compliments up and
down the elevator-shaft; the refusal to send up more
coal, the solid splash of the water upon his head, the
language he sends up the shaft, the triumphant laughter
of the cook, to her kitchen retiring.
</p>
<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>4. The widow's small house in the suburbs of the city; the
widow's boy coming home from his first day down
town; he is flushed with happiness and pride; he is no
longer a school-boy, he is earning money; he takes
on the airs of a man and talks learnedly of business.
</p>
<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>5. The room in the third-class boarding-house; the mean
little hard-coal fire, the slovenly Irish servant-girl
making it, the ashes on the hearth, the faded furniture,
the private provender hid away in the closet, the
dreary backyard out the window; the young girl at the
glass, with her mouth full of hairpins, doing up her
hair to go downstairs and flirt with the young fellows
in the parlor.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg&nbsp;505]</a></span>

<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>6. The kitchen of the old farm-house; the young convict just
returned from prison&mdash;it was his first offense, and the
judges were lenient on him.
</p>
<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>He is taking his first meal out of prison; he has been received
back, kiss'd, encourag'd to start again; his
lungs, his nostrils expand with the big breaths of free
air; with shame, with wonderment, with a trembling
joy, his heart too, expanding.
</p>
<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>The old mother busies herself about the table; she has ready
for him the dishes he us'd to like; the father sits with
his back to them, reading the newspaper, the newspaper
shaking and rustling much; the children hang
wondering around the prodigal&mdash;they have been caution'd:
Do not ask where our Jim has been; only say
you are glad to see him.
</p>
<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>The elder daughter is there, palefac'd, quiet; her young man
went back on her four years ago; his folks would not
let him marry a convict's sister. She sits by the
window, sewing on the children's clothes, the clothes
not only patching up; her hunger for children of her
own invisibly patching up.
</p>
<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>The brother looks up; he catches her eye, he fearful, apologetic;
she smiles back at him, not reproachfully smiling,
with loving pretence of hope smiling&mdash;it is too
much for him; he buries his face in the folds of the
mother's black gown.
</p>
<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>7. The best room of the house, on the Sabbath only open'd;
the smell of horse-hair furniture and mahogany varnish;
the ornaments on the what-not in the corner; the
wax fruit, dusty, sunken, sagged in, consumptive-looking,
under a glass globe, the sealing-wax imitation
of coral; the cigar boxes with shells plastered over, the
perforated card-board motto.
</p>
<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>The kitchen; the housewife sprinkling the clothes for the
fine ironing to-morrow&mdash;it is the Third-day night, and
the plain things are ready iron'd, now in cupboards,
in drawers stowed away.
</p>
<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>The wife waiting for the husband&mdash;he is at the tavern, jovial,
carousing; she, alone in the kitchen sprinkling clothes&mdash;the
little red wood clock with peaked top, with pendulum

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg&nbsp;506]</a></span>

wagging behind a pane of gayly painted glass,
strikes twelve.
</p>
<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>The sound of the husband's voice on the still night air&mdash;he is
singing: "We won't go home until morning!"&mdash;the
wife arising, toward the wood-shed hastily going,
stealthily entering, the voice all the time coming
nearer, inebriate, chantant.
</p>
<p style='text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em;'>The husband passing the door of the wood-shed; the club
over his head, now with his head in contact; the
sudden cessation of the song; the benediction of peace
over the domestic foyer temporarily resting.
</p>
<p style='margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em;'>I sing the soothing influences of home.</p>

You knew her?&mdash;Mary the small,<br />
How of a summer,&mdash;or, no, was it fall?<br />
You'd never have thought it, never believed,<br />
But the girl owned a lamb last fall.<br />
<br />
Its wool was subtly, silky white,<br />
Color of lucent obliteration of night,<br />
Like the shimmering snow or&mdash;our Clothild's arm!<br />
You've seen her arm&mdash;her right, I mean&mdash;<br />
The other she scalded a-washing, I ween&mdash;<br />
How white it is and soft and warm?<br />
<br />
Ah, there was soul's heart-love, deep, true, and tender,<br />
Wherever went Mary, the maiden so slender,<br />
There followed, his all-absorbed passion, inciting,<br />
That passionate lambkin&mdash;her soul's heart delighting&mdash;<br />
Ay, every place that Mary sought in,<br />
That lamb was sure to soon be caught in.<br />

Fair the daughter known as Mary,<br />
Fair and full of fun and laughter,<br />
Owned a lamb, a little he-goat,<br />
Owned him all herself and solely.<br />
White the lamb's wool as the Gotchi&mdash;<br />
The great Gotchi, driving snowstorm.<br />
Hither Mary went and thither,<br />
But went with her to all places,<br />
Sure as brook to run to river,<br />
Her pet lambkin following with her.<br />

<h3>DIVERSIONS OF THE RE-ECHO CLUB</h3>
<div class='blockquot'>It is with pleasure that we announce our ability to offer to
the public the papers of the Re-Echo Club. This club, somewhat
after the order of the Echo Club, late of Boston, takes pleasure
in trying to better what is done. On the occasion of the meeting
of which the following gems of poesy are the result, the several
members of the club engaged to write up the well-known tradition
of the Purple Cow in more elaborate form than the
quatrain made famous by Mr. Gelett Burgess:</div>

I couldn't help weeping with delight<br />
When the boys kissed me and called me sweet.<br />
It was foolish, I know,<br />
To weep when I was glad;<br />
But I was young and I wasn't very well.<br />
I was nervous, weak, anemic,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg&nbsp;522]</a></span>

A sort of human mimosa; and I hadn't much brains,<br />

But they didn't frown often,<br />
For I was sweetly pretty and most pliable.<br />
But, oh, the grim joke of asking Ben Bolt if he remembered me!<br />
Me!<br />
Why, it was Ben Bolt who&mdash;<br />
Well, never mind. He paid for this granite slab,<br />

Then Mr. Rossetti wrote about me.<br />
He described me all dolled up in some ladies' wearing apparel<br />
That I wore at a fancy ball.<br />
I had fasted all day, and had had my hair marcelled<br />
And my face corrected.<br />
And I <i>was</i> a dream.<br />

And then laugh at me through her dimples!<br />
She was my bespoke.<br />
And I'd beg her to have the banns called,&mdash;<br />
But there was no pinning her down.<br />
Well, she was so bonny<br />
That like a fool, I said I'd lay me doon<br />
And dee for her.<br />
And,&mdash;like a fool,&mdash;<br />

<h3>ANSWER TO MASTER WITHER'S SONG, "SHALL
I, WASTING IN DESPAIR?"</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Shall I, mine affections slack,<br />
'Cause I see a woman's black?<br />
Or myself, with care cast down,<br />
'Cause I see a woman brown?<br />
Be she blacker than the night,<br />
Or the blackest jet in sight!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If she be not so to me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What care I how black she be?</span><br />
<br />
Shall my foolish heart be burst,<br />
'Cause I see a woman's curst?<br />
Or a thwarting hoggish nature<br />
Join&egrave;d in as bad a feature?<br />
Be she curst or fiercer than<br />
Brutish beast, or savage man!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If she be not so to me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What care I how curst she be?</span><br />
<br />
Shall a woman's vices make<br />
Me her vices quite forsake?<br />
Or her faults to me made known,<br />
Make me think that I have none?<br />
Be she of the most accurst,<br />
And deserve the name of worst!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If she be not so to me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What care I how bad she be?</span><br />
<br />
'Cause her fortunes seem too low,<br />
Shall I therefore let her go?<br />
He that bears an humble mind<br />
And with riches can be kind,<br />
Think how kind a heart he'd have,<br />
If he were some servile slave!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And if that same mind I see</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What care I how poor she be?</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg&nbsp;527]</a></span>

<br />
Poor, or bad, or curst, or black,<br />
I will ne'er the more be slack!<br />
If she hate me (then believe!)<br />
She shall die ere I will grieve!<br />
If she like me when I woo<br />
I can like and love her too!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If that she be fit for me!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What care I what others be?</span><br />

<h3>SONG OF THE SPRINGTIDE</h3>

O Season supposed of all free flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made lovely by light of the sun,</span><br />
Of garden, of field, and of tree-flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy singers are surely in fun!</span><br />
Or what is it wholly unsettles<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy sequence of shower and shine,</span><br />
And maketh thy pushings and petals<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To shrivel and pine?</span><br />
<br />
Why is it that o'er the wild waters<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That beastly North-Easter still blows,</span><br />
Dust-dimming the eyes of our daughters,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blue-nipping each nice little nose?</span><br />
Why is it these sea-skirted islands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are plagued with perpetual chills,</span><br />
Driving men to Italian or Nile-lands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From Albion's ills?</span><br />
<br />
Happy he, O Springtide, who hath found thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All sunlit, in luckier lands,</span><br />
With thy garment of greenery round thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And belted with blossomy bands.</span><br />
From us by the blast thou art drifted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All brag of thy beauties is bosh;</span><br />
When the songs of thy singers are sifted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They simply won't wash.</span><br />

To sing thee,&mdash;oh, bitter derision!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A season of laughter and love?</span><br />
You make a man mad beyond measure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O Spring, and thy lauders like thee:</span><br />
Thy flowers, thy pastimes and pleasures,<br />

Dire the percenter's glare,<br />
Flashed his pitchfork in air<br />
Sounding fresh keys to bear<br />

Swiftly he turned his back,<br />
Reached he his hat from rack,<br />

<h3>A POE-'EM OF PASSION</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
It was many and many a year ago,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On an island near the sea,</span><br />
That a maiden lived whom you mightn't know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the name of Cannibalee;</span><br />
And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than a passionate fondness for me.</span><br />
<br />
I was a child, and she was a child&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tho' her tastes were adult Feejee&mdash;</span><br />
But she loved with a love that was more than love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My yearning Cannibalee;</span><br />
With a love that could take me roast or fried<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or raw, as the case might be.</span><br />
<br />
And that is the reason that long ago,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that island near the sea,</span><br />
I had to turn the tables and eat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My ardent Cannibalee&mdash;</span><br />
Not really because I was fond of her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But to check her fondness for me.</span><br />
<br />
But the stars never rise but I think of the size<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of my hot-potted Cannibalee,</span><br />
And the moon never stares but it brings me nightmares<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of my spare-rib Cannibalee;</span><br />
And all the night-tide she is restless inside,<br />
Is my still indigestible dinner-belle bride,<br />
In her pallid tomb, which is Me,<br />
In her solemn sepulcher, Me.<br />

To Urn, or not to Urn? that is the question:<br />
Whether 'tis nobler for our frames to suffer<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg&nbsp;535]</a></span>

And by consuming, end them? To Urn&mdash;to keep&mdash;<br />
No more: and while we keep, to say we end<br />
Contagion and the thousand graveyard ills<br />
That flesh is heir to&mdash;'tis a consume-ation<br />
Devoutly to be wished! To burn&mdash;to keep&mdash;<br />
To keep! Perchance to lose&mdash;aye, there's the rub:<br />
For in the course of things what duns may come,<br />
Or who may shuffle off our Dresden urn,<br />
Must give us pause. There's the respect<br />
That makes inter-i-ment of so long use.<br />
For who would have the pall and plumes of hire,<br />
The tradesman's prize&mdash;a proud man's obsequies,<br />
The chaffering for graves, the legal fee,<br />
The cemetery beadle and the rest,<br />
When he himself might his few ashes make<br />
With a mere furnace? Who would tombstones bear,<br />
And lie beneath a lying epitaph,<br />
But that the dread of simmering after death&mdash;<br />
That uncongenial furnace from whose burn<br />
No incremate returns&mdash;weakens the will,<br />
And makes us rather bear the graves we have<br />
Than fly to ovens that we know not of?<br />
This, Thompson, does make cowards of us all.<br />
And thus the wisdom of incineration<br />
Is thick-laid o'er with the pale ghost of nought,<br />
And incremators of great pith and courage<br />
With this regard their faces turn awry,<br />
And shudder at cremation.<br />

The trees that grow upon the shore,<br />
Have grown a hundred years or more;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So long there is no knowing.</span><br />
Old Daniel Dobson does not know<br />
When first these trees began to grow;<br />
But still they grew, and grew, and grew,<br />
As if they'd nothing else to do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But ever to be growing.</span><br />
<br />
The impulses of air and sky<br />
Have rear'd their stately heads so high,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And clothed their boughs with green;</span><br />
Their leaves the dews of evening quaff,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when the wind blows loud and keen,</span><br />
I've seen the jolly timbers laugh,<br />

Wagging their heads in mockery.<br />
<br />
Fix'd are their feet in solid earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where winds can never blow;</span><br />
But visitings of deeper birth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have reach'd their roots below.</span><br />
For they have gain'd the river's brink,<br />
And of the living waters drink.<br />
<br />
There's little Will, a five years child&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He is my youngest boy:</span><br />
To look on eyes so fair and wild,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is a very joy:&mdash;</span><br />
He hath conversed with sun and shower<br />
And dwelt with every idle flower,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As fresh and gay as them.</span><br />
He loiters with the briar rose,&mdash;<br />
The blue-belles are his play-fellows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That dance upon their slender stem.</span><br />
<br />
And I have said, my little Will,<br />
Why should not he continue still<br />

<h3>THE LAY OF THE LOVE-LORN</h3>

<h4>PARODY ON TENNYSON'S "LOCKSLEY HALL"</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Comrades, you may pass the rosy. With permission of the chair,<br />
I shall leave you for a little, for I'd like to take the air.<br />
<br />
Whether 'twas the sauce at dinner, or that glass of ginger-beer,<br />
Or these strong cheroots, I know not, but I feel a little queer.<br />
<br />
Let me go. Now, Chuckster, blow me, 'pon my soul, this is too bad!<br />
When you want me, ask the waiter, he knows where I'm to be had!<br />
<br />
Whew! This is a great relief now! Let me but undo my stock;<br />
Resting here beneath the porch, my nerves will steady like a rock.<br />
<br />
In my ears I hear the singing of a lot of favourite tunes&mdash;<br />
Bless my heart, how very odd! Why, surely, there's a brace of moons!<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg&nbsp;538]</a></span>

<br />
See&mdash;the stars! How bright they twinkle, winking with a frosty glare,<br />
Like my faithless cousin Amy when she drove me to despair.<br />
<br />
Oh, my cousin, spider-hearted! Oh, my Amy! No, confound it!<br />
I must wear the mournful willow&mdash;all around my hat I've bound it.<br />
<br />
Falser than the Bank of Fancy, frailer than a shilling glove,<br />
Puppet to a father's anger, minion to a nabob's love!<br />
<br />
Is it well to wish thee happy? Having known me, could you ever<br />
Stoop to marry half a heart, and little more than half a liver?<br />
<br />
Happy! Damme! Thou shalt lower to his level day by day,<br />
Changing from the best of china to the commonest of clay.<br />
<br />
As the husband is, the wife is. He is stomach-plagued and old,<br />
And his curry soups will make thy cheek the colour of his gold.<br />
<br />
When his feeble love is sated, he will hold thee surely then<br />
Something lower than his hookah, something less than his cayenne.<br />
<br />
What is this? His eyes are pinky. Was't the claret? Oh, no, no&mdash;<br />
Bless your soul, it was the salmon&mdash;salmon always makes him so.<br />
<br />
Take him to thy dainty chamber, soothe him with thy lightest fancies,<br />
He will understand thee, won't he&mdash;pay thee with a lover's glances?<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg&nbsp;539]</a></span>

<br />
Louder than the loudest trumpet, harsh as harshest ophicleide,<br />
Nasal respirations answer the endearments of his bride.<br />
<br />
Sweet response, delightful music! Gaze upon thy noble charge<br />
Till the spirit fill thy bosom that inspired the meek Lafarge.<br />
<br />
Better thou wert dead before me, better, better that I stood<br />
Looking on thy murdered body, like the injured Daniel Good!<br />
<br />
Better thou and I were lying, cold and limber-stiff and dead,<br />
With a pan of burning charcoal underneath our nuptial bed!<br />
<br />
Cursed be the Bank of England's notes, that tempt the soul to sin!<br />
Cursed be the want of acres&mdash;doubly cursed the want of tin!<br />
<br />
Cursed be the marriage contract, that enslaved thy soul to greed!<br />
Cursed be the sallow lawyer, that prepared and drew the deed!<br />
<br />
Cursed be his foul apprentice, who the loathsome fees did earn!<br />
Cursed be the clerk and parson&mdash;cursed be the whole concern!<br />
<br />
Oh, 'tis well that I should bluster; much I'm like to make of that.<br />
Better comfort have I found in singing "All Around My Hat."<br />
<br />
But that song, so wildly plaintive, palls upon my British ears.<br />
'Twill not do to pine for ever: I am getting up in years.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg&nbsp;540]</a></span>

<br />
Can't I turn the honest penny, scribbling for the weekly press,<br />
And in writing Sunday libels drown my private wretchedness?<br />
<br />
Oh, to feel the wild pulsation that in manhood's dawn I knew,<br />
When my days were all before me, and my years were twenty-two;<br />
<br />
When I smoked my independent pipe along the Quadrant wide,<br />
With the many larks of London flaring up on every side;<br />
<br />
When I went the pace so wildly, caring little what might come,<br />
Coffee-milling care and sorrow, with a nose-adapted thumb;<br />
<br />
Felt the exquisite enjoyment, tossing nightly off, oh, heavens!<br />
Brandy at the Cider Cellars, kidneys smoking-hot at Evans';<br />
<br />
Or in the Adelphi sitting, half in rapture, half in tears,<br />
Saw the glorious melodrama conjure up the shades of years&mdash;<br />
<br />
Saw Jack Sheppard, noble stripling, act his wondrous feats again,<br />
Snapping Newgate's bars of iron, like an infant's daisy chain;<br />
<br />
Might was right, and all the terrors which had held the world in awe<br />
Were despised and prigging prospered, spite of Laurie, spite of law.<br />
<br />
In such scenes as these I triumphed, ere my passion's edge was rusted,<br />
And my cousin's cold refusal left me very much disgusted!<br />
<br />
Since, my heart is sore and withered, and I do not care a curse<br />
Whether worse shall be the better, or the better be the worse.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg&nbsp;541]</a></span>

<br />
Hark! my merry comrades call me, bawling for another jorum;<br />
They would mock me in derision, should I thus appear before 'em.<br />
<br />
Womankind no more shall vex me, such, at least, as go arrayed<br />
In the most expensive satins, and the newest silk brocade.<br />
<br />
I'll to Afric, lion-haunted, where the giant forest yields<br />
Rarer robes and finer tissue than are sold at Spitalfields.<br />
<br />
Or to burst all chains of habit, flinging habit's self aside,<br />
I shall walk the tangled jungle in mankind's primeval pride;<br />
<br />
Feeding on the luscious berries and the rich casava root,<br />
Lots of dates and lots of guavas, clusters of forbidden fruit.<br />
<br />
Never comes the trader thither, never o'er the purple main<br />
Sounds the oath of British commerce, or the accents of Cockaigne.<br />
<br />
There, methinks, would be enjoyment, where no envious rule prevents;<br />
Sink the steamboats! Cuss the railways! Rot, oh, rot the Three per Cents!<br />
<br />
There the passions, cramped no longer, shall have space to breathe, my cousin!<br />
I will take some savage woman&mdash;nay, I'll take at least a dozen.<br />
<br />
There I'll rear my young mulattoes, as no Bond Street brats are reared:<br />
They shall dive for alligators, catch the wild goats by the beard,<br />
<br />
Whistle to the cockatoos, and mock the hairy-faced baboon,<br />
Worship mighty Mumbo Jumbo, in the mountains of the Moon.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg&nbsp;542]</a></span>

<br />
I, myself, in far Timbuctoo, leopard's blood will daily quaff,<br />
Ride a-tiger-hunting, mounted on a thorough-bred giraffe.<br />
<br />
Fiercely shall I shout the war-whoop, as some sullen stream he crosses,<br />
Startling from their noon-day slumbers iron-bound rhinoceroses.<br />
<br />
Fool! Again, the dream, the fancy! But I know my words are mad,<br />
For I hold the gray barbarian lower than the Christian cad.<br />
<br />
I, the swell, the city dandy! I to seek such horrid places,<br />
I to haunt with squalid Negroes, blubber-lips, and monkey faces!<br />
<br />
I to wed with Coromantees! I, who managed&mdash;very near&mdash;<br />
To secure the heart and fortune of the widow Shillibeer!<br />
<br />
Stuff and nonsense! Let me never fling a single chance away.<br />
Maids ere now, I know, have loved me, and another maiden may.<br />
<br />
<i>Morning Post</i> (<i>The Times</i> won't trust me), help me, as I know you can;<br />
I will pen an advertisement&mdash;that's a never-failing plan:<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">Wanted</span>&mdash;By a bard in wedlock, some young interesting woman.<br />
Looks are not so much an object, if the shiners be forthcoming!<br />
<br />
"Hymen's chains, the advertiser vows, shall be but silken fetters.<br />
Please address to A. T., Chelsea. N.B.&mdash;You must pay the letters."<br />
<br />
That's the sort of thing to do it. Now I'll go and taste the balmy.<br />
Rest thee with thy yellow nabob, spider-hearted cousin Amy!<br />

<h3>ONLY SEVEN</h3>

<h4>A PASTORAL STORY AFTER WORDSWORTH</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
I marvell'd why a simple child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That lightly draws its breath,</span><br />
Should utter groans so very wild,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And look as pale as Death.</span><br />
<br />
Adopting a parental tone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I ask'd her why she cried;</span><br />
The damsel answered with a groan,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I've got a pain inside!</span><br />
<br />
"I thought it would have sent me mad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Last night about eleven."</span><br />
Said I, "What is it makes you bad?<br />
How many apples have you had?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She answered, "Only seven!"</span><br />
<br />
"And are you sure you took no more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My little maid?" quoth I;</span><br />
"Oh, please, sir, mother gave me four,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But <i>they</i> were in a pie!"</span><br />
<br />
"If that's the case," I stammer'd out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Of course you've had eleven."</span><br />
The maiden answer'd with a pout,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I ain't had more nor seven!"</span><br />
<br />
I wonder'd hugely what she meant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And said, "I'm bad at riddles;</span><br />
But I know where little girls are sent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For telling taradiddles.</span><br />
<br />
"Now, if you won't reform," said I,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You'll never go to Heaven."</span><br />
But all in vain; each time I try,<br />
That little idiot makes reply,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I ain't had more nor seven!"</span><br />

<h3>LITTLE BILLEE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
There were three sailors of Bristol City<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who took a boat and went to sea,</span><br />
But first with beef and captain's biscuits,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pickled pork they loaded she.</span><br />
<br />
There was gorging Jack, and guzzling Jimmy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the youngest he was little Billee.</span><br />
Now when they'd got as far as the Equator<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They'd nothing left but one split pea.</span><br />
<br />
Says gorging Jack to guzzling Jimmy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I am extremely hungaree."</span><br />
To gorging Jack says guzzling Jimmy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"We've nothing left, us must eat we."</span><br />
<br />
Says gorging Jack to guzzling Jimmy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"With one another we shouldn't agree!</span><br />
There's little Bill, he's young and tender,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"We're old and tough, so let's eat he."</span><br />
<br />
"O Billy! we're going to kill and eat you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So undo the button of your chemie."</span><br />
When Bill received this information,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He used his pocket-handkerchie.</span><br />
<br />
"First let me say my catechism,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which my poor mother taught to me."</span><br />
"Make haste! make haste!" says guzzling Jimmy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While Jack pulled out his snicker-snee.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg&nbsp;547]</a></span>

<br />
Then Bill went up to the main-top-gallant-mast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And down he fell on his bended knee,</span><br />
He scarce had come to the Twelfth Commandment<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When up he jumps&mdash;"There's land I see!"</span><br />
<br />
"Jerusalem and Madagascar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And North and South Amerikee,</span><br />
There's the British flag a-riding at anchor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With Sir Admiral Napier, K.C.B."</span><br />
<br />
So when they got aboard of the Admiral's,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He hanged fat Jack and flogged Jimmee,</span><br />
But as for little Bill, he made him<br />

<h3>THE WOFLE NEW BALLAD OF JANE RONEY
AND MARY BROWN</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
An igstrawnary tail I vill tell you this veek&mdash;<br />
I stood in the Court of A'Beckett the Beak,<br />
Vere Mrs. Jane Roney, a vidow, I see,<br />
Who charged Mary Brown with a robbin' of she.<br />
<br />
This Mary was pore and in misery once,<br />
And she came to Mrs. Roney it's more than twelve monce<br />
She adn't got no bed, nor no dinner, nor no tea,<br />
And kind Mrs. Roney gave Mary all three.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Roney kep Mary for ever so many veeks<br />
(Her conduct disgusted the best of all Beax),<br />
She kept her for nothink, as kind as could be,<br />
Never thinking that this Mary was a traitor to she.<br />
<br />
"Mrs. Roney, O Mrs. Roney, I feel very ill;<br />
Will you jest step to the doctor's for to fetch me a pill?"<br />
"That I will, my pore Mary," Mrs. Roney says she:<br />
And she goes off to the doctor's as quickly as may be.<br />
<br />
No sooner on this message Mrs. Roney was sped,<br />
Than hup gits vicked Mary, and jumps out a bed;<br />
She hopens all the trunks without never a key&mdash;<br />
She bustes all the boxes, and vith them makes free.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Roney's best linning gownds, petticoats, and close,<br />
Her children's little coats and things, her boots and her hose,<br />
She packed them, and she stole 'em, and avay vith them did flee<br />
Mrs. Roney's situation&mdash;you may think vat it vould be!<br />
<br />
Of Mary, ungrateful, who had served her this vay,<br />
Mrs. Roney heard nothink for a long year and a day,<br />
Till last Thursday, in Lambeth, ven whom should she see?<br />
But this Mary, as had acted so ungrateful to she.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg&nbsp;553]</a></span>

<br />
She was leaning on the helbo of a worthy young man;<br />
They were going to be married, and were walkin hand in hand;<br />
And the church-bells was a ringing for Mary and he,<br />
And the parson was ready, and a waitin' for his fee.<br />
<br />
When up comes Mrs. Roney, and faces Mary Brown,<br />
Who trembles, and castes her eyes upon the ground.<br />
She calls a jolly pleaseman, it happens to be me;<br />
I charge this young woman, Mr. Pleaseman, says she.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Roney, o, Mrs. Roney, o, do let me go,<br />
I acted most ungrateful I own, and I know,<br />
But the marriage bell is ringin, and the ring you may see,<br />
And this young man is a waitin, says Mary, says she.<br />
<br />
I don't care three fardens for the parson and clark,<br />
And the bell may keep ringing from noon day to dark.<br />
Mary Brown, Mary Brown, you must come along with me.<br />
And I think this young man is lucky to be free.<br />
<br />
So, in spite of the tears which bejewed Mary's cheek,<br />
I took that young gurl to A'Beckett the Beak;<br />
That exlent justice demanded her plea&mdash;<br />
But never a sullable said Mary said she.<br />
<br />
On account of her conduck so base and so vile,<br />
That wicked young gurl is committed for trile,<br />
And if she's transpawted beyond the salt sea,<br />
It's a proper reward for such willians as she.<br />
<br />
Now, you young gurls of Southwark for Mary who veep,<br />
From pickin and stealin your ands you must keep,<br />
Or it may be my dooty, as it was Thursday veek<br />
To pull you all hup to A'Beckett the Beak.<br />

<h3>KING JOHN AND THE ABBOT</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
An ancient story Ile tell you anon<br />
Of a notable prince, that was called King John;<br />
And he ruled England with maine and with might,<br />
For he did great wrong, and maintein'd little right.<br />
<br />
And Ile tell you a story, a story so merrye,<br />
Concerning the Abbot of Canterb&ugrave;rye;<br />
How for his house-keeping, and high renowne,<br />
They rode poste for him to fair London towne.<br />
<br />
An hundred men, the king did heare say,<br />
The abbot kept in his house every day;<br />
And fifty golde chaynes, without any doubt,<br />
In velvet coates waited the abbot about.<br />
<br />
How now, father abbot, I heare it of thee,<br />
Thou keepest a farre better house than mee,<br />
And for thy house-keeping and high renowne,<br />
I feare thou work'st treason against my crown.<br />
<br />
My liege, quo' the abbot, I would it were knowne,<br />
I never spend nothing but what is my owne;<br />
And I trust your grace will doe me no deere<br />
For spending of my owne true-gotten geere.<br />
<br />
Yes, yes, father abbot, thy fault it is highe,<br />
And now for the same thou needest must dye;<br />
For except thou canst answer me questions three,<br />
Thy head shall be smitten from thy bodie.<br />
<br />
And first, quo' the king, when I'm in this stead,<br />
With my crowne of golde so faire on my head,<br />
Among all my liege-men, so noble of birthe,<br />
Thou must tell me to one penny what I am worthe.<br />
<br />
Secondlye, tell me, without any doubt,<br />
How soone I may ride the whole world about,<br />
And at the third question thou must not shrink,<br />
But tell me here truly what I do think.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg&nbsp;555]</a></span>

<br />
O, these are hard questions for my shallow witt,<br />
Nor I cannot answer your grace as yet;<br />
But if you will give me but three weekes space,<br />
Ile do my endeavour to answer your grace.<br />
<br />
Now three weeks space to thee will I give.<br />
And that is the longest time thou hast to live;<br />
For if thou dost not answer my questions three,<br />
Thy lands and thy livings are forfeit to mee.<br />
<br />
Away rode the abbot, all sad at that word,<br />
And he rode to Cambridge and Oxenford;<br />
But never a doctor there was so wise,<br />
That could with his learning an answer devise.<br />
<br />
Then home rode the abbot, of comfort so cold,<br />
And he mett his shepheard agoing to fold:<br />
How now, my lord abbot, you are welcome home<br />
What newes do you bring us from good King John?<br />
<br />
Sad newes, sad newes, shepheard, I must give:<br />
That I have but three days more to live;<br />
For if I do not answer him questions three,<br />
My head will be smitten from my bodie.<br />
<br />
The first is to tell him there in that stead,<br />
With his crowne of golde so fair on his head<br />
Among all his liege-men so noble of birth,<br />
To within one penny of what he is worth.<br />
<br />
The seconde, to tell him, without any doubt,<br />
How soone he may ride this whole world about:<br />
And at the third question I must not shrinke,<br />
But tell him there truly what he does thinke.<br />
<br />
Now cheare up, sire abbot, did you never hear yet,<br />
That a fool he may learne a wise man witt?<br />
Lend me horse, and serving-men, and your apparel,<br />
And I'll ride to London to answere your quarrel.<br />
<br />
Nay frowne not, if it hath bin told unto mee,<br />
I am like your lordship, as ever may bee:<br />
And if you will but lend me your gowne,<br />
There is none shall knowe us in fair London towne.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg&nbsp;556]</a></span>

<br />
Now horses and serving-men thou shalt have,<br />
With sumptuous array most gallant and brave;<br />
With crozier, and miter, and rochet, and cope,<br />
Fit to appears 'fore our fader the pope.<br />
<br />
Now welcome, sire abbot, the king he did say,<br />
'Tis well thou'rt come back to keepe thy day;<br />
For and if thou canst answer my questions three,<br />
Thy life and thy living both saved shall bee.<br />
<br />
And first, when thou seest me here in this stead,<br />
With my crown of golde so fair on my head,<br />
Among all my liege-men so noble of birthe,<br />
Tell me to one penny what I am worth.<br />
<br />
For thirty pence our Saviour was sold<br />
Among the false Jewes, as I have bin told:<br />
And twenty-nine is the worth of thee,<br />
For I thinke, thou art one penny worser than hee.<br />
<br />
The king he laughed, and swore by St. Bittel,<br />
I did not think I had been worth so littel!<br />
&mdash;Now secondly tell me, without any doubt,<br />
How soone I may ride this whole world about.<br />
<br />
You must rise with the sun, and ride with the same,<br />
Until the next morning he riseth againe;<br />
And then your grace need not make any doubt<br />
But in twenty-four hours you'll ride it about.<br />
<br />
The king he laughed, and swore by St. Jone,<br />
I did not think it could be gone so soone!<br />
&mdash;Now from the third question thou must not shrinke,<br />
But tell me here truly what I do thinke.<br />
<br />
Yea, that shall I do, and make your grace merry:<br />
You thinke I'm the abbot of Canterb&ugrave;ry;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg&nbsp;557]</a></span>

But I'm his poor shepheard, as plain you may see,<br />
That am come to beg pardon for him and for mee.<br />
<br />
The king he laughed, and swore by the masse,<br />
Ile make thee lord abbot this day in his place!<br />
Now naye, my liege, be not in such speede,<br />
For alacke I can neither write, ne reade.<br />
<br />
Four nobles a week, then, I will give thee,<br />
For this merry jest thou hast showne unto mee:<br />
And tell the old abbot, when thou comest home,<br />
Thou hast brought him a pardon from good King John.<br />

<h3>ON THE DEATH OF A FAVORITE CAT,</h3>

<h4>DROWNED IN A TUB OF GOLDFISHES</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
'Twas on a lofty vase's side,<br />
Where China's gayest art had dyed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The azure flowers that blow,</span><br />
Demurest of the tabby kind,<br />
The pensive Selima, reclined,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gazed on the lake below.</span><br />
<br />
Her conscious tail her joy declared;<br />
The fair round face, the snowy beard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The velvet of her paws,</span><br />
Her coat that with the tortoise vies,<br />
Her ears of jet, and emerald eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She saw, and purred applause.</span><br />
<br />
Still had she gaz'd, but, 'midst the tide,<br />
Two angel forms were seen to glide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Genii of the stream:</span><br />
Their scaly armor's Tyrian hue,<br />
Through richest purple, to the view<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Betrayed a golden gleam.</span><br />

The hapless nymph with wonder saw:<br />
A whisker first, and then a claw,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With many an ardent wish,</span><br />
She stretched in vain to reach the prize:<br />
What female heart can gold despise?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What Cat's averse to fish?</span><br />
<br />
Presumptuous maid! with looks intent,<br />
Again she stretched, again she bent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor knew the gulf between:</span><br />
(Malignant Fate sat by and smiled)<br />
The slippery verge her feet beguiled;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She tumbled headlong in.</span><br />
<br />
Eight times emerging from the flood,<br />
She mewed to every watery god<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some speedy aid to send.</span><br />
No Dolphin came, no Nereid stirred,<br />
Nor cruel Tom or Susan heard:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A fav'rite has no friend!</span><br />
<br />
From hence, ye Beauties! undeceived,<br />
Know one false step is ne'er retrieved,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And be with caution bold:</span><br />
Not all that tempts your wandering eyes,<br />
And heedless hearts, is lawful prize,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor all that glistens gold.</span><br />

<h3>MISADVENTURES AT MARGATE</h3>

<h4>A LEGEND OF JARVIS'S JETTY</h4>

<p class='h_5'>MR. SIMPKINSON (<i>loquitur</i>)</p>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
I was in Margate last July, I walk'd upon the pier,<br />
I saw a little vulgar Boy&mdash;I said "What make you here?&mdash;<br />
The gloom upon your youthful cheek speaks any thing but joy;"<br />
Again I said, "What make you here, you little vulgar Boy?"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg&nbsp;559]</a></span>
<br />
He frown'd, that little vulgar Boy&mdash;he deem'd I meant to scoff:<br />
And when the little heart is big, a little "sets it off";<br />
He put his finger in his mouth, his little bosom rose,&mdash;<br />
He had no little handkerchief to wipe his little nose!<br />
<br />
"Hark! don't you hear, my little man?&mdash;it's striking nine," I said,<br />
"An hour when all good little boys and girls should be in bed.<br />
Run home and get your supper, else your Ma' will scold&mdash;Oh! fie!&mdash;<br />
It's very wrong indeed for little boys to stand and cry!"<br />
<br />
The tear-drop in his little eye again began to spring,<br />
His bosom throbb'd with agony&mdash;he cried like any thing!<br />
I stoop'd, and thus amidst his sobs I heard him murmur&mdash;"Ah<br />
I haven't got no supper! and I haven't got no Ma'!!&mdash;<br />
<br />
"My father, he is on the seas,&mdash;my mother's dead and gone!<br />
And I am here, on this here pier, to roam the world alone;<br />
I have not had, this live-long day, one drop to cheer my heart,<br />
Nor '<i>brown</i>' to buy a bit of bread with,&mdash;let alone a tart.<br />
<br />
"If there's a soul will give me food, or find me in employ,<br />
By day or night, then blow me tight!" (he was a vulgar Boy);<br />
"And now I'm here, from this here pier it is my fixed intent<br />
To jump, as Mr. Levi did from off the Monu-ment!"<br />
<br />
"Cheer up! cheer up! my little man&mdash;cheer up!" I kindly said.<br />
"You are a naughty boy to take such things into your head:<br />
If you should jump from off the pier, you'd surely break your legs,<br />
Perhaps your neck&mdash;then Bogey'd have you, sure as eggs are eggs!<br />
<br />
"Come home with me, my little man, come home with me and sup;<br />
My landlady is Mrs. Jones&mdash;we must not keep her up&mdash;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg&nbsp;560]</a></span>

There's roast potatoes on the fire,&mdash;enough for me and you&mdash;<br />
Come home,&mdash;you little vulgar Boy&mdash;I lodge at Number 2."<br />
<br />
I took him home to Number 2, the house beside "The Foy,"<br />
I bade him wipe his dirty shoes,&mdash;that little vulgar Boy,&mdash;<br />
And then I said to Mistress Jones, the kindest of her sex,<br />
"Pray be so good as go and fetch a pint of double X!"<br />
<br />
But Mrs. Jones was rather cross, she made a little noise,<br />
She said she "did not like to wait on little vulgar Boys."<br />
She with her apron wiped the plates, and, as she rubb'd the delf,<br />
Said I might "go to Jericho, and fetch my beer myself!"<br />
<br />
I did not go to Jericho&mdash;I went to Mr. Cobb&mdash;<br />
I changed a shilling&mdash;(which in town the people call "a Bob")&mdash;<br />
It was not so much for myself as for that vulgar child&mdash;<br />
And I said, "A pint of double X, and please to draw it mild!"<br />
<br />
When I came back I gazed about&mdash;I gazed on stool and chair&mdash;<br />
I could not see my little friend&mdash;because he was not there!<br />
I peep'd beneath the table-cloth&mdash;beneath the sofa too&mdash;<br />
I said "You little vulgar Boy! why what's become of you?"<br />
<br />
I could not see my table-spoons&mdash;I look'd, but could not see<br />
The little fiddle-pattern'd ones I use when I'm at tea;<br />
&mdash;I could not see my sugar-tongs&mdash;my silver watch&mdash;oh, dear!<br />
I know 'twas on the mantle-piece when I went out for beer.<br />
<br />
I could not see my Mackintosh!&mdash;it was not to be seen!<br />
Nor yet my best white beaver hat, broad-brimm'd and lined with green;<br />
My carpet-bag&mdash;my cruet-stand, that holds my sauce and soy,&mdash;<br />
My roast potatoes!&mdash;all are gone!&mdash;and so's that vulgar Boy!<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg&nbsp;561]</a></span>
<br />
I rang the bell for Mrs. Jones, for she was down below,<br />
"&mdash;Oh, Mrs. Jones! what <i>do</i> you think?&mdash;ain't this a pretty go?<br />
&mdash;That horrid little vulgar Boy whom I brought here to-night,<br />
&mdash;He's stolen my things and run away!!"&mdash;Says she, "And sarve you right!!"
</p>

<hr style='width: 33%; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em' />

<p>Next morning I was up betimes&mdash;I sent the Crier round,<br />
All with his bell and gold-laced hat, to say I'd give a pound<br />
To find that little vulgar Boy, who'd gone and used me so;<br />
But when the Crier cried "O Yes!" the people cried, "O No!"<br />
<br />
I went to "Jarvis' Landing-place," the glory of the town,<br />
There was a common sailor-man a-walking up and down;<br />
I told my tale&mdash;he seem'd to think I'd not been treated well,<br />
And called me "Poor old Buffer!" what that means I cannot tell.<br />
<br />
That sailor-man, he said he'd seen that morning on the shore,<br />
A son of&mdash;something&mdash;'twas a name I'd never heard before,<br />
A little "gallows-looking chap"&mdash;dear me; what could he mean?<br />
With a "carpet-swab" and "muckingtogs," and a hat turned up with green.<br />
<br />
He spoke about his "precious eyes," and said he'd seen him "sheer,"<br />
&mdash;It's very odd that sailor-men should talk so very queer&mdash;<br />
And then he hitch'd his trowsers up, as is, I'm told, their use,<br />
&mdash;It's very odd that sailor-men should wear those things so loose.<br />
<br />
I did not understand him well, but think he meant to say<br />
He'd seen that little vulgar Boy, that morning swim away<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg&nbsp;562]</a></span>

In Captain Large's Royal George about an hour before,<br />
And they were now, as he supposed, "some<i>wheres</i>" about the Nore.<br />
<br />
A landsman said, "I <i>twig</i> the chap&mdash;he's been upon the Mill&mdash;<br />
And 'cause he <i>gammons</i> so the flats, ve calls him Veeping Bill!"<br />
He said "he'd done me wery brown," and "nicely <i>stow'd</i> the <i>swag</i>."<br />
&mdash;That's French, I fancy, for a hat&mdash;or else a carpet-bag.<br />
<br />
I went and told the constable my property to track;<br />
He asked me if "I did not wish that I might get it back?"<br />
I answered, "To be sure I do!&mdash;it's what I come about."<br />
He smiled and said, "Sir, does your mother know that you are out?"<br />
<br />
Not knowing what to do, I thought I'd hasten back to town,<br />
And beg our own Lord Mayor to catch the Boy who'd "done me brown."<br />
His Lordship very kindly said he'd try and find him out,<br />
But he "rather thought that there were several vulgar boys about."<br />
<br />
He sent for Mr. Whithair then, and I described "the swag,"<br />
My Mackintosh, my sugar-tongs, my spoons, and carpet-bag;<br />
He promised that the New Police should all their powers employ;<br />
But never to this hour have I beheld that vulgar Boy!<br />
</p>
<p class='h_5'>MORAL</p>
<p>
Remember, then, what when a boy I've heard my Grandma' tell,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Be warn'd in time by others' harm, and you shall do full well!</span>"<br />
Don't link yourself with vulgar folks, who've got no fix'd abode,<br />
Tell lies, use naughty words, and say they "wish they may be blow'd!"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg&nbsp;563]</a></span>
<br />
Don't take too much of double X!&mdash;and don't at night go out<br />
To fetch your beer yourself, but make the pot-boy bring your stout!<br />
And when you go to Margate next, just stop and ring the bell,<br />
Give my respects to Mrs. Jones, and say I'm pretty well!<br />

So said, so done; he made no more remark<br />

<h3>THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN</h3>

<h4>SHOWING HOW HE WENT FARTHER THAN HE INTENDED AND
CAME SAFE HOME AGAIN</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
John Gilpin was a citizen of credit and renown;<br />
A train-band captain eke was he, of famous London town.<br />
<br />
John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear&mdash;"Though wedded we have been<br />
These twice ten tedious years, yet we no holiday have seen.<br />
<br />
"To-morrow is our wedding-day, and we will then repair<br />
Unto the Bell at Edmonton all in a chaise and pair.<br />
<br />
"My sister, and my sister's child, myself, and children three,<br />
Will fill the chaise; so you must ride on horseback after we."<br />
<br />
He soon replied, "I do admire of womankind but one,<br />
And you are she, my dearest dear; therefore it shall be done.<br />
<br />
"I am a linendraper bold, as all the world doth know;<br />
And my good friend, the calender, will lend his horse to go."<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg&nbsp;565]</a></span>
<br />
Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, "That's well said; and, for that wine is dear,<br />
We will be furnished with our own, which is both bright and clear."<br />
<br />
John Gilpin kissed his loving wife; o'erjoyed was he to find<br />
That, though on pleasure she was bent, she had a frugal mind.<br />
<br />
The morning came, the chaise was brought, but yet was not allowed<br />
To drive up to the door, lest all should say that she was proud.<br />
<br />
So three doors off the chaise was stayed, where they did all get in&mdash;<br />
Six precious souls, and all agog to dash through thick and thin.<br />
<br />
Smack went the whip, round went the wheels&mdash;were never folks so glad;<br />
The stones did rattle underneath, as if Cheapside were mad.<br />
<br />
John Gilpin at his horse's side seized fast the flowing mane,<br />
And up he got, in haste to ride&mdash;but soon came down again:<br />
<br />
For saddletree scarce reached had he, his journey to begin,<br />
When, turning round his head, he saw three customers come in.<br />
<br />
So down he came: for loss of time, although it grieved him sore,<br />
Yet loss of pence, full well he knew, would trouble him much more.<br />
<br />
'Twas long before the customers were suited to their mind;<br />
When Betty, screaming, came down-stairs&mdash;"The wine is left behind!"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg&nbsp;566]</a></span>
<br />
"Good lack!" quoth he&mdash;"yet bring it me, my leathern belt likewise,<br />
In which I wear my trusty sword when I do exercise."<br />
<br />
Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!) had two stone bottles found,<br />
To hold the liquor that she loved, and keep it safe and sound.<br />
<br />
Each bottle had a curling ear, through which the belt he drew,<br />
And hung a bottle on each side to make his balance true.<br />
<br />
Then over all, that he might be equipped from top to toe,<br />
His long red cloak, well brushed and neat, he manfully did throw.<br />
<br />
Now see him mounted once again upon his nimble steed,<br />
Full slowly pacing o'er the stones, with caution and good heed.<br />
<br />
But finding soon a smoother road beneath his well-shod feet,<br />
The snorting beast began to trot, which galled him in his seat.<br />
<br />
So, "Fair and softly," John he cried, but John he cried in vain;<br />
That trot became a gallop soon, in spite of curb and rein.<br />
<br />
So stooping down, as needs he must who cannot sit upright,<br />
He grasped the mane with both his hands, and eke with all his might.<br />
<br />
His horse, who never in that sort had handled been before,<br />
What thing upon his back had got did wonder more and more.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg&nbsp;567]</a></span>
<br />
Away went Gilpin, neck or nought; away went hat and wig;<br />
He little dreamt, when he set out, of running such a rig.<br />
<br />
The wind did blow&mdash;the cloak did fly, like streamer long and gay;<br />
Till, loop and button failing both, at last it flew away.<br />
<br />
Then might all people well discern the bottles he had slung&mdash;<br />
A bottle swinging at each side, as hath been said or sung.<br />
<br />
The dogs did bark, the children screamed, up flew the windows all;<br />
And every soul cried out, "Well done!" as loud as he could bawl.<br />
<br />
Away went Gilpin&mdash;who but he? His fame soon spread around&mdash;<br />
"He carries weight! he rides a race! 'Tis for a thousand pound!"<br />
<br />
And still as fast as he drew near, 'twas wonderful to view<br />
How in a trice the turnpike men their gates wide open threw.<br />
<br />
And now, as he went bowing down his reeking head full low,<br />
The bottles twain behind his back were shattered at a blow.<br />
<br />
Down ran the wine into the road, most piteous to be seen,<br />
Which made his horse's flanks to smoke as they had basted been.<br />
<br />
But still he seemed to carry weight, with leathern girdle braced;<br />
For all might see the bottle necks still dangling at his waist.<br />
<br />
Thus all through merry Islington these gambols did he play,<br />
Until he came unto the Wash of Edmonton so gay;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg&nbsp;568]</a></span>
<br />
And there he threw the wash about on both sides of the way,<br />
Just like unto a trundling mop, or a wild goose at play.<br />
<br />
At Edmonton his loving wife from the balcony spied<br />
Her tender husband, wondering much to see how he did ride.<br />
<br />
"Stop, stop, John Gilpin! here's the house," they all at once did cry;<br />
"The dinner waits, and we are tired." Said Gilpin&mdash;"So am I!"<br />
<br />
But yet his horse was not a whit inclined to tarry there;<br />
For why?&mdash;his owner had a house full ten miles off, at Ware.<br />
<br />
So like an arrow swift he flew, shot by an archer strong:<br />
So did he fly&mdash;which brings me to the middle of my song.<br />
<br />
Away went Gilpin out of breath, and sore against his will,<br />
Till at his friend the calender's his horse at last stood still.<br />
<br />
The calender, amazed to see his neighbor in such trim,<br />
Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate, and thus accosted him:<br />
<br />
"What news? what news? your tidings tell; tell me you must and shall&mdash;<br />
Say why bareheaded you are come, or why you come at all?"<br />
<br />
Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit, and loved a timely joke;<br />
And thus unto the calender in merry guise he spoke:<br />
<br />
"I came because your horse would come; and, if I well forebode,<br />
My hat and wig will soon be here, they are upon the road."<br />
<br />
The calender, right glad to find his friend in merry pin,<br />
Returned him not a single word, but to the house went in;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg&nbsp;569]</a></span>
<br />
Whence straight he came with hat and wig: a wig that flowed behind,<br />
A hat not much the worse for wear&mdash;each comedy in its kind.<br />
<br />
He held them up, and in his turn thus showed his ready wit&mdash;<br />
"My head is twice as big as yours, they therefore needs must fit.<br />
<br />
"But let me scrape the dirt away that hangs upon your face,<br />
And stop and eat, for well you may be in a hungry case."<br />
<br />
Said John, "It is my wedding-day, and all the world would stare,<br />
If wife should dine at Edmonton, and I should dine at Ware."<br />
<br />
So, turning to his horse, he said, "I am in haste to dine;<br />
'Twas for your pleasure you came here&mdash;you shall go back for mine."<br />
<br />
Ah, luckless speech, and bootless boast, for which he paid full dear!<br />
For, while he spake, a braying ass did sing most loud and clear;<br />
<br />
Whereat his horse did snort, as he had heard a lion roar,<br />
And galloped off with all his might, as he had done before.<br />
<br />
Away went Gilpin, and away went Gilpin's hat and wig:<br />
He lost them sooner than at first, for why?&mdash;they were too big.<br />
<br />
Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw her husband posting down<br />
Into the country far away, she pulled out half a crown;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg&nbsp;570]</a></span>
<br />
And thus unto the youth she said, that drove them to the Bell,<br />
"This shall be yours when you bring back my husband safe and well."<br />
<br />
The youth did ride, and soon did meet John coming back amain&mdash;<br />
Whom in a trice he tried to stop, by catching at his rein;<br />
<br />
But not performing what he meant, and gladly would have done,<br />
The frighted steed he frighted more, and made him faster run.<br />
<br />
Away went Gilpin, and away went post-boy at his heels,<br />
The post-boy's horse right glad to miss the lumbering of the wheels.<br />
<br />
Six gentlemen upon the road, thus seeing Gilpin fly,<br />
With post-boy scampering in the rear, they raised the hue and cry:<br />
<br />
"Stop thief! stop thief!&mdash;a highwayman!" Not one of them was mute;<br />
And all and each that passed that way did join in the pursuit.<br />
<br />
And now the turnpike gates again flew open in short space;<br />
The tollmen thinking, as before, that Gilpin rode a race.<br />
<br />
And so he did, and won it, too, for he got first to town;<br />
Nor stopped till where he had got up he did again get down.<br />
<br />
Now let us sing, long live the king! and Gilpin, long live he;<br />
And when he next doth ride abroad, may I be there to see!<br />

<h3>PADDY O'RAFTHER</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Paddy, in want of a dinner one day,<br />
Credit all gone, and no money to pay,<br />
Stole from a priest a fat pullet, they say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And went to confession just afther;</span><br />
"Your riv'rince," says Paddy, "I stole this fat hen."<br />
"What, what!" says the priest, "at your ould thricks again?<br />
Faith, you'd rather be staalin' than sayin' <i>amen</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Paddy O'Rafther!"</span><br />
<br />
"Sure, you wouldn't be angry," says Pat, "if you knew<br />
That the best of intintions I had in my view&mdash;<br />
For I stole it to make it a present to you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And you can absolve me afther."</span><br />
"Do you think," says the priest, "I'd partake of your theft?<br />
Of your seven small senses you must be bereft&mdash;<br />
You're the biggest blackguard that I know, right and left,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Paddy O'Rafther."</span><br />
<br />
"Then what shall I do with the pullet," says Pat,<br />
"If your riv'rince won't take it? By this and by that<br />
I don't know no more than a dog or a cat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What your riv'rince would have me be afther."</span><br />
"Why, then," says his rev'rence, "you sin-blinded owl,<br />
Give back to the man that you stole from his fowl:<br />
For if you do not, 'twill be worse for your sowl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Paddy O'Rafther."</span><br />
<br />
Says Paddy, "I ask'd him to take it&mdash;'tis thrue<br />
As this minit I'm talkin', your riv'rince, to you;<br />
But he wouldn't resaive it&mdash;so what can I do?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says Paddy, nigh choken with laughter.</span><br />
"By my throth," says the priest, "but the case is absthruse;<br />
If he won't take his hen, why the man is a goose:<br />
'Tis not the first time my advice was no use,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Paddy O'Rafther."</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg&nbsp;572]</a></span>
<br />
"But, for sake of your sowl, I would sthrongly advise<br />
To some one in want you would give your supplies&mdash;<br />
Some widow, or orphan, with tears in their eyes;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And <i>then</i> you may come to <i>me</i> afther."</span><br />
So Paddy went off to the brisk Widow Hoy,<br />
And the pullet between them was eaten with joy,<br />
And, says she, "'Pon my word you're the cleverest boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Paddy O'Rafther."</span><br />
<br />
Then Paddy went back to the priest the next day,<br />
And told him the fowl he had given away<br />
To a poor lonely widow, in want and dismay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The loss of her spouse weeping afther.</span><br />
"Well, now," says the priest, "I'll absolve you, my lad,<br />
For repentantly making the best of the bad,<br />
In feeding the hungry and cheering the sad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Paddy O'Rafther!"</span><br />

<h3>HERE SHE GOES, AND THERE SHE GOES</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Two Yankee wags, one summer day,<br />
Stopped at a tavern on their way,<br />
Supped, frolicked, late retired to rest,<br />
And woke to breakfast on the best.<br />
The breakfast over, Tom and Will<br />
Sent for the landlord and the bill;<br />
Will looked it over:&mdash;"Very right&mdash;<br />
But hold! what wonder meets my sight?<br />
Tom, the surprise is quite a shock!"<br />
"What wonder? where?" "The clock, the clock!"<br />
<br />
Tom and the landlord in amaze<br />
Stared at the clock with stupid gaze,<br />
And for a moment neither spoke;<br />
At last the landlord silence broke,&mdash;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg&nbsp;573]</a></span>

"You mean the clock that's ticking there?<br />
I see no wonder, I declare!<br />
Though maybe, if the truth were told,<br />
'Tis rather ugly, somewhat old;<br />
Yet time it keeps to half a minute;<br />
But, if you please, what wonder's in it?"<br />
<br />
"Tom, don't you recollect," said Will,<br />
"The clock at Jersey, near the mill,<br />
The very image of this present,<br />
With which I won the wager pleasant?"<br />
Will ended with a knowing wink;<br />
Tom scratched his head and tried to think.<br />
"Sir, begging pardon for inquiring,"<br />
The landlord said, with grin admiring,<br />
"What wager was it?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">"You remember</span><br />
It happened, Tom, in last December:<br />
In sport I bet a Jersey Blue<br />
That it was more than he could do<br />
To make his finger go and come<br />
In keeping with the pendulum,<br />
Repeating, till the hour should close,<br />
Still,&mdash;'<i>Here she goes, and there she goes</i>.'<br />
He lost the bet in half a minute."<br />
<br />
"Well, if I would, the deuce is in it!"<br />
Exclaimed the landlord; "try me yet,<br />
And fifty dollars be the bet."<br />
"Agreed, but we will play some trick,<br />
To make you of the bargain sick!"<br />
"I'm up to that!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">"Don't make us wait,&mdash;</span><br />
Begin,&mdash;the clock is striking eight."<br />
He seats himself, and left and right<br />
His finger wags with all its might,<br />
And hoarse his voice and hoarser grows,<br />
With&mdash;"<i>Here she goes, and there she goes</i>!"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg&nbsp;574]</a></span>
<br />
"Hold!" said the Yankee, "Plank the ready!"<br />
The landlord wagged his finger steady,<br />
While his left hand, as well as able,<br />
Conveyed a purse upon the table.<br />
"Tom! with the money let's be off!"<br />
This made the landlord only scoff.<br />
<br />
He heard them running down the stair,<br />
But was not tempted from his chair;<br />
Thought he, "The fools! I'll bite them yet!<br />
So poor a trick sha'n't win the bet."<br />
And loud and long the chorus rose<br />
Of&mdash;<i>"Here she goes, and there she goes!"</i><br />
While right and left his finger swung,<br />
In keeping to his clock and tongue.<br />
<br />
His mother happened in to see<br />
Her daughter: "Where is Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;?"<br />
"When will she come, do you suppose?<br />
Son!"&mdash;</p>
<p class='poem' style='text-align: right;'><i>"Here she goes, and there she goes!"</i></p>
<p>
"Here!&mdash;where?"&mdash;the lady in surprise<br />
His finger followed with her eyes:<br />
"Son! why that steady gaze and sad?<br />
Those words,&mdash;that motion,&mdash;are you mad?<br />
But here's your wife, perhaps she knows,<br />
And&mdash;"</p>
<p class='poem' style='text-align: right;'><i>"Here she goes, and there she goes!"</i></p>
<p>
His wife surveyed him with alarm,<br />
And rushed to him, and seized his arm;<br />
He shook her off, and to and fro<br />
His finger persevered to go;<br />
While curled his very nose with ire<br />
That <i>she</i> against him should conspire;<br />
And with more furious tone arose<br />
The&mdash;<i>"Here she goes, and there she goes!"</i><br />
<br />
"Lawks!" screamed the wife, "I'm in a whirl!<br />
Run down and bring the little girl;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg&nbsp;575]</a></span>
She is his darling, and who knows<br />
But&mdash;"</p>
<p class='poem' style='text-align: right;'><i>"Here she goes, and there she goes!"</i></p>
<p>
"Lawks! he is mad! What made him thus?<br />
Good Lord! what will become of us?<br />
Run for a doctor,&mdash;run, run, run,&mdash;<br />
For Doctor Brown and Doctor Dun,<br />
And Doctor Black and Doctor White,<br />
And Doctor Gray, with all your might!"<br />
<br />
The doctors came, and looked, and wondered,<br />
And shook their heads, and paused and pondered.<br />
Then one proposed he should be bled,&mdash;<br />
"No, leeched you mean," the other said,<br />
"Clap on a blister!" roared another,&mdash;<br />
"No! cup him,"&mdash;"No, trepan him, brother."<br />
A sixth would recommend a purge,<br />
The next would an emetic urge;<br />
The last produced a box of pills,<br />
A certain cure for earthly ills:<br />
"I had a patient yesternight,"<br />
Quoth he, "and wretched was her plight,<br />
And as the only means to save her,<br />
Three dozen patent pills I gave her;<br />
And by to-morrow I suppose<br />
That&mdash;"</p>
<p class='poem' style='text-align: right;'><i>"Here she goes, and there she goes!"</i></p>
<p>"You are all fools!" the lady said,&mdash;<br />
"The way is just to shave his head.<br />
Run! bid the barber come anon."<br />
"Thanks, mother!" thought her clever son;<br />
"You help the knaves that would have bit me,<br />
But all creation sha'n't outwit me!"<br />
Thus to himself while to and fro<br />
His finger perseveres to go,<br />
And from his lips no accent flows<br />
But,&mdash;<i>"Here she goes, and there she goes!"</i><br />
The barber came&mdash;"Lord help him! what<br />
A queerish customer I've got;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg&nbsp;576]</a></span>

But we must do our best to save him,&mdash;<br />
So hold him, gemmen, while I shave him!"<br />
But here the doctors interpose,&mdash;<br />
"A woman never&mdash;"</p>
<p class='poem' style='text-align: right;'><i>"There she goes!"</i></p>
<p>
"A woman is no judge of physic,<br />
Not even when her baby is sick.<br />
He must be bled,"&mdash;"No, cup him,"&mdash;"Pills!"<br />
And all the house the uproar fills.<br />
<br />
What means that smile? what means that shiver?<br />
The landlord's limbs with rapture quiver,<br />
And triumph brightens up his face,<br />
His finger yet will win the race;<br />
The clock is on the stroke of nine,<br />
And up he starts,&mdash;"'Tis mine! 'tis mine!"<br />
"What do you mean?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">"I mean the fifty;</span><br />
I never spent an hour so thrifty.<br />
But you who tried to make me lose,<br />
Go, burst with envy, if you choose!<br />
But how is this? where are they?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">"Who?"</span><br />
"The gentlemen,&mdash;I mean the two<br />
Came yesterday,&mdash;are they below?"<br />

<h3>THE QUAKER'S MEETING</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
A traveller wended the wilds among,<br />
With a purse of gold and a silver tongue;<br />
His hat it was broad, and all drab were his clothes,<br />
For he hated high colors&mdash;except on his nose,<br />
And he met with a lady, the story goes.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Heigho! <i>yea</i> thee and <i>nay</i> thee.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg&nbsp;577]</a></span>

<br />
The damsel she cast him a merry blink,<br />
And the traveller nothing was loth, I think,<br />
Her merry black eye beamed her bonnet beneath,<br />
And the Quaker, he grinned, for he'd very good teeth,<br />
And he asked, "Art thee going to ride on the heath?"<br />
<br />
"I hope you'll protect me, kind sir," said the maid,<br />
"As to ride this heath over, I'm sadly afraid;<br />
For robbers, they say, here in numbers abound,<br />
And I wouldn't for anything I should be found,<br />
For, between you and me, I have five hundred pound."<br />
<br />
"If that is thee own, dear," the Quaker, he said,<br />
"I ne'er saw a maiden I sooner would wed;<br />
And I have another five hundred just now,<br />
In the padding that's under my saddle-bow,<br />
And I'll settle it all upon thee, I vow!"<br />
<br />
The maiden she smil'd, and her rein she drew,<br />
"Your offer I'll take, but I'll not take you,"<br />
A pistol she held at the Quaker's head&mdash;<br />
"Now give me your gold, or I'll give you my lead,<br />
'Tis under the saddle, I think you said."<br />
<br />
The damsel she ripped up the saddle-bow,<br />
And the Quaker was never a quaker till now!<br />
And he saw, by the fair one he wished for a bride,<br />
His purse borne away with a swaggering stride,<br />
And the eye that shamm'd tender, now only defied.<br />
<br />
"The spirit doth move me, friend Broadbrim," quoth she,<br />
"To take all this filthy temptation from thee,<br />
For Mammon deceiveth, and beauty is fleeting,<br />
Accept from thy maiden this right-loving greeting,<br />
For much doth she profit by this Quaker's meeting!<br />
<br />
"And hark! jolly Quaker, so rosy and sly,<br />
Have righteousness, more than a wench, in thine eye;<br />
Don't go again peeping girls' bonnets beneath,<br />
Remember the one that you met on the heath,<br />
Her name's Jimmy Barlow, I tell to your teeth."<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg&nbsp;578]</a></span>

<br />
"Friend James," quoth the Quaker, "pray listen to me,<br />
For thou canst confer a great favor, d'ye see;<br />
The gold thou hast taken is not mine, my friend,<br />
But my master's; and truly on thee I depend,<br />
To make it appear I my trust did defend.<br />
<br />
"So fire a few shots thro' my clothes, here and there,<br />
To make it appear 'twas a desp'rate affair."<br />
So Jim he popp'd first through the skirt of his coat,<br />
And then through his collar&mdash;quite close to his throat;<br />
"Now one thro' my broadbrim," quoth Ephraim, "I vote."<br />
<br />
"I have but a brace," said bold Jim, "and they're spent,<br />
And I won't load again for a make-believe rent."&mdash;<br />
"Then!"&mdash;said Ephraim, producing his pistols, "just give<br />
My five hundred pounds back, or, as sure as you live,<br />
I'll make of your body a riddle or sieve."<br />
<br />
Jim Barlow was diddled&mdash;and, tho' he was game,<br />
He saw Ephraim's pistol so deadly in aim,<br />
That he gave up the gold, and he took to his scrapers,<br />
And when the whole story got into the papers,<br />
They said that "<i>the thieves were no match for the Quakers</i>."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Heigho! <i>yea</i> thee and <i>nay</i> thee.</span><br />

<h3>THE JESTER CONDEMNED TO DEATH</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
One of the Kings of Scanderoon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A royal jester</span><br />
Had in his train, a gross buffoon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who used to pester</span><br />
The court with tricks inopportune,<br />
Venting on the highest folks his<br />
Scurvy pleasantries and hoaxes.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg&nbsp;579]</a></span>
<br />
It needs some sense to play the fool,<br />
Which wholesome rule<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Occurred not to our jackanapes,</span><br />
Who consequently found his freaks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lead to innumerable scrapes,</span><br />
And quite as many tricks and tweaks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which only seemed to make him faster</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Try the patience of his master.</span><br />
<br />
Some sin, at last, beyond all measure<br />
Incurred the desperate displeasure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of his Serene and raging Highness:</span><br />
Whether he twitched his most revered<br />
And sacred beard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or had intruded on the shyness</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the seraglio, or let fly</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An epigram at royalty,</span><br />
None knows: his sin was an occult one,<br />
But records tell us that the Sultan,<br />
Meaning to terrify the knave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Exclaimed, "'Tis time to stop that breath;</span><br />
Thy doom is sealed, presumptuous slave!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou stand'st condemned to certain death:</span><br />
<br />
"Silence, base rebel! no replying!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But such is my indulgence still,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That, of my own free grace and will,</span><br />
I leave to thee the mode of dying,"<br />
"Thy royal will be done&mdash;'tis just,"<br />
Replied the wretch, and kissed the dust.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Since my last moment to assuage,</span><br />
Your majesty's humane decree<br />
Has deigned to leave the choice to me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll die, so please you, of old age!"</span><br />

<h3>THE DEACON'S MASTERPIECE;</h3>

<h4>OR, THE WONDERFUL "ONE-HOSS SHAY"</h4>
<p class='h_5'><i>A Logical Story</i></p>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>

<p>
Have you heard of the wonderful one-hoss shay,<br />
That was built in such a logical way,<br />
It ran a hundred years to a day,<br />
And then, of a sudden, it&mdash;ah, but stay,<br />
I'll tell you what happened without delay,&mdash;<br />
Scaring the parson into fits,<br />
Frightening the people out of their wits&mdash;<br />
Have you ever heard of that, I say?<br />
<br />
Seventeen hundred and fifty-five,<br />
<i>Georgius Secundus</i> was then alive&mdash;<br />
Stuffy old drone from the German hive.<br />
That was the year when Lisbon-town<br />
Saw the earth open and gulp her down,<br />
And Braddock's army was done so brown,<br />
Left without a scalp to its crown.<br />
It was on the terrible earthquake-day<br />
That the Deacon finished his one-hoss shay.<br />
<br />
Now in building of chaises, I'll tell you what,<br />
There is always <i>somewhere</i> a weakest spot&mdash;<br />
In hub, tire, or felloe, in spring or thill,<br />
In panel, or crossbar, or floor, or sill,<br />
In screw, bolt, thorough brace&mdash;lurking still,<br />
Find it somewhere you must and will&mdash;<br />
Above or below, or within or without&mdash;<br />
And that's the reason, beyond a doubt,<br />
A chaise <i>breaks down</i>, but doesn't <i>wear out</i>.<br />
<br />
But the Deacon swore (as Deacons do,<br />
With an "I dew vam" or an "I tell <i>yeou</i>"),<br />
He would build one shay to beat the taown<br />
'n' the keounty 'n' all the kentry raoun';<br />
It should be so built that it <i>couldna'</i> break daown;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg&nbsp;581]</a></span>
<br />
&mdash;"Fur," said the Deacon, "'t's mighty plain<br />
That the weakes' place mus' stan' the strain;<br />
'n' the way t' fix it, uz I maintain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Is only jest</span><br />
T' make that place uz strong uz the rest."<br />
<br />
So the deacon inquired of the village folk<br />
Where he could find the strongest oak,<br />
That couldn't be split nor bent nor broke&mdash;<br />
That was for spokes and floor and sills;<br />
He sent for lancewood to make the thills;<br />
The cross-bars were ash, from the straightest trees;<br />
The panels of white-wood, that cuts like cheese,<br />
But lasts like iron for things like these;<br />
The hubs of logs from the "Settler's ellum"&mdash;<br />
Last of its timber&mdash;they couldn't sell 'em,<br />
<br />
Never an axe had seen their chips,<br />
And the wedges flew from between their lips;<br />
Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips;<br />
Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,<br />
Spring, tire, axle, and linch-pin too,<br />
Steel of the finest, bright and blue;<br />
Thorough-broke bison-skin, thick and wide;<br />
Boot, top, dasher, from tough old hide<br />
Found in the pit when the tanner died.<br />
That was the way he "put her through"&mdash;<br />
"There!" said the deacon, "naow she'll dew!"<br />
<br />
Do! I tell you, I rather guess<br />
She was a wonder, and nothing less.<br />
Colts grew horses, beards turned gray,<br />
Deacon and deaconess dropped away,<br />
Children and grandchildren&mdash;where were they!<br />
But there stood the stout old one-hoss shay<br />
As fresh as on Lisbon earthquake-day!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Eighteen hundred</span>;&mdash;it came and found<br />
The deacon's masterpiece strong and sound.<br />
Eighteen hundred increased by ten;&mdash;<br />
"Hahnsum kerridge" they called it then.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg&nbsp;582]</a></span>

Eighteen hundred and twenty came;&mdash;<br />
Running as usual; much the same.<br />
Thirty and forty at last arrive,<br />
And then came fifty and <span class="smcap">fifty-five</span>.<br />
<br />
Little of all we value here<br />
Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year<br />
Without both feeling and looking queer.<br />
In fact, there's nothing that keeps its youth,<br />
So far as I know but a tree and truth.<br />
(That is a moral that runs at large;<br />
Take it&mdash;you're welcome.&mdash;No extra charge.)<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">First of November</span>&mdash;The Earthquake-day&mdash;<br />
There are traces of age in the one-hoss shay,<br />
A general flavour of mild decay,<br />
But nothing local, as one may say.<br />
There couldn't be&mdash;for the deacon's art<br />
Had made it so like in every part<br />
That there wasn't a chance for one to start.<br />
For the wheels were just as strong as the thills,<br />
And the floor was just as strong as the sills,<br />
And the panels just as strong as the floor,<br />
And the whippletree neither less nor more,<br />
And the back-crossbar as strong as the fore,<br />
And spring and axle and hub <i>encore</i>.<br />
And yet, <i>as a whole</i> it is past a doubt<br />
In another hour it will be <i>worn out</i>!<br />
<br />
First of November, 'Fifty-five!<br />
This morning the parson takes a drive.<br />
Now, small boys, get out of the way!<br />
Here comes the wonderful one-hoss shay,<br />
Drawn by a rat-tailed, ewe-necked bay,<br />
"Huddup!" said the parson.&mdash;Off went they.<br />
<br />
The parson was working his Sunday's text&mdash;<br />
Had got to <i>fifthly</i>, and stopped perplexed<br />
At what the&mdash;Moses&mdash;was coming next.<br />
All at once the horse stood still,<br />
Close by the meet'n'-house on the hill.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg&nbsp;583]</a></span>
<br />
&mdash;First a shiver, and then a thrill,<br />
Then something decidedly like a spill&mdash;<br />
And the parson was sitting upon a rock<br />
At half-past nine by the meet'n'-house clock&mdash;<br />
Just the hour of the earthquake shock!<br />
&mdash;What do you think the parson found,<br />
When he got up and stared around?<br />
The poor old chaise in a heap or mound,<br />
As if it had been to the mill and ground!<br />
You see, of course, if you're not a dunce,<br />
How it went to pieces all at once,&mdash;<br />
All at once and nothing first&mdash;<br />
Just as bubbles do when they burst.<br />
<br />
End of the wonderful one-hoss shay.<br />
Logic is logic. That's all I say.<br />

<h3>THE BALLAD OF THE OYSTERMAN</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
It was a tall young oysterman lived by the river-side;<br />
His shop was just upon the bank, his boat was on the tide.<br />
The daughter of a fisherman, that was so straight and slim,<br />
Lived over on the other bank, right opposite to him.<br />
<br />
It was the pensive oysterman that saw a lovely maid,<br />
Upon a moonlight evening, a-sitting in the shade;<br />
He saw her wave her handkerchief, as much as if to say,<br />
"I'm wide awake, young oysterman, and all the folks away."<br />
<br />
Then up arose the oysterman, and to himself said he,<br />
"I guess I'll leave the skiff at home, for fear that folks should see;<br />
I read it in the story-book, that, for to kiss his dear,<br />
Leander swam the Hellespont&mdash;and I will swim this here."<br />
<br />
And he has leaped into the waves, and crossed the shining stream,<br />
And he has clambered up the bank, all in the moonlight gleam;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg&nbsp;584]</a></span>

O there were kisses sweet as dew, and words as soft as rain&mdash;<br />
But they have heard her father's step, and in he leaps again!<br />
<br />
Out spoke the ancient fisherman&mdash;"O what was that, my daughter?"<br />
"'Twas nothing but a pebble, sir, I threw into the water."<br />
"And what is that, pray tell me, love, that paddles off so fast?"<br />
"It's nothing but a porpoise, sir, that's been a-swiinming past."<br />
<br />
Out spoke the ancient fisherman&mdash;"Now bring me my harpoon!<br />
I'll get into my fishing-boat, and fix the fellow soon."<br />
Down fell that pretty innocent, as falls a snow-white lamb;<br />
Her hair drooped round her pallid cheeks, like sea-weed on a clam.<br />
<br />
Alas for those two loving ones! she waked not from her swound,<br />
And he was taken with the cramp, and in, the waves was drowned;<br />
But Fate has metamorphosed them, in pity of their wo,<br />
And now they keep an oyster-shop for mermaids down below.<br />

<h3>THE WELL OF ST. KEYNE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
A well there is in the west country,<br />
And a clearer one never was seen;<br />
There is not a wife in the west country<br />
But has heard of the Well of St. Keyne.<br />
<br />
An oak and an elm-tree stand beside,<br />
And behind doth an ash-tree grow,<br />
And a willow from the bank above<br />
Droops to the water below.<br />
<br />
A traveller came to the Well of St. Keyne,<br />
Joyfully he drew nigh,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg&nbsp;585]</a></span>

For from cock-crow he had been travelling,<br />
And there was not a cloud in the sky.<br />
<br />
He drank of the water so cool and clear,<br />
For thirsty and hot was he;<br />
And he sat down upon the bank<br />
Under the willow-tree.<br />
<br />
There came a man from the house hard by<br />
At the well to fill his pail;<br />
On the well-side he rested it,<br />
And he bade the stranger hail.<br />
<br />
"Now art thou a bachelor, stranger?" quoth he,<br />
"For an if thou hast a wife,<br />
The happiest draught thou hast drank this day<br />
That ever thou didst in thy life.<br />
<br />
"Or hast thy good woman, if one thou hast,<br />
Ever here in Cornwall been?<br />
For an if she have, I'll venture my life<br />
She has drank of the Well of St. Keyne."<br />
<br />
"I have left a good woman who never was here,"<br />
The stranger he made reply;<br />
"But that my draught should be the better for that<br />
I pray you answer me why?"<br />
<br />
"St. Keyne," quoth the Cornishman, "many a time<br />
Drank of this crystal well,<br />
And before the angels summon'd her,<br />
She laid on the water a spell.<br />
<br />
"If the husband of this gifted well<br />
Shall drink before his wife,<br />
A happy man thenceforth is he,<br />
For he shall be master for life.<br />
<br />
"But if the wife should drink of it first,<br />
God help the husband then!"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg&nbsp;586]</a></span>

The stranger stooped to the Well of St. Keyne,<br />
And drank of the water again.<br />
<br />
"You drank of the well, I warrant, betimes?"<br />
He to the Cornishman said:<br />
But the Cornishman smiled as the stranger spake,<br />
And sheepishly shook his head.<br />
<br />
"I hasten'd as soon as the wedding was done,<br />
And left my wife in the porch;<br />
But i' faith she had been wiser than me,<br />
For she took a bottle to church."<br />

<h3>THE JACKDAW OF RHEIMS</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
The Jackdaw sat on the Cardinal's chair!<br />
Bishop, and Abbot, and Prior were there;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Many a monk, and many a friar,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Many a knight and many a squire,</span><br />
With a great many more of lesser degree&mdash;<br />
In sooth, a goodly company;<br />
And they served the Lord Primate on bended knee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Never, I ween,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Was a prouder seen,</span><br />
Read of in books, or dreamt of in dreams,<br />
Than the Cardinal Lord Archbishop of Rheims!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In and out</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Through the motley rout,</span><br />
That little Jackdaw kept hopping about;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Here and there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Like a dog in a fair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Over comfits and cates,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And dishes and plates,</span><br />
Cowl and cope, and rochet and pall,<br />
Mitre and crosier, he hopped upon all!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With saucy air,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He perched on the chair</span><br />
Where, in state, the great Lord Cardinal sat<br />
In the great Lord Cardinal's great red hat;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg&nbsp;587]</a></span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And he peered in the face</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of his Lordship's grace,</span><br />
With a satisfied look, as if he would say,<br />
"We two are the greatest folks here to-day!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And the priests, with awe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">As such freaks they saw,</span><br />
Said, "The devil must be in that little Jackdaw!"<br />
<br />
The feast was over, the board was cleared,<br />
The flawns and the custards had all disappeared,<br />
And six little singing-boys&mdash;dear little souls!<br />
In nice clean faces, and nice white stoles,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Came, in order due,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Two by two,</span><br />
Marching that grand refectory through!<br />
<br />
A nice little boy held a golden ewer,<br />
Embossed and filled with water, as pure<br />
As any that flows between Rheims and Namur,<br />
Which a nice little boy stood ready to catch<br />
In a fine golden hand-basin made to match.<br />
Two nice little boys, rather more grown,<br />
Carried lavender-water and eau-de-Cologne;<br />
And a nice little boy had a nice cake of soap,<br />
Worthy of washing the hands of the Pope.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">One little boy more</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A napkin bore,</span><br />
Of the best white diaper, fringed with pink,<br />
And a cardinal's hat marked in "permanent ink."<br />
<br />
The great Lord Cardinal turns at the sight<br />
Of these nice little boys dressed all in white:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">From his finger he draws</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His costly turquoise,</span><br />
And, not thinking at all about little Jackdaws,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Deposits it straight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">By the side of his plate,</span><br />
While the nice little boys on his Eminence wait;<br />
Till, when nobody's dreaming of any such thing,<br />
That little Jackdaw hops off with the ring!<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg&nbsp;588]</a></span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">There's a cry and a shout,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And a deuce of a rout,</span><br />
And nobody seems to know what they're about,<br />
But the monks have their pockets all turned inside out;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The friars are kneeling,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And hunting and feeling</span><br />
The carpet, the floor, and the walls, and the ceiling.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The Cardinal drew</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Off each plum-coloured shoe,</span><br />
And left his red stockings exposed to the view;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He peeps and he feels,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In the toes and the heels;</span><br />
They turn up the dishes, they turn up the plates,<br />
They take up the poker and poke out the grates,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">They turn up the rugs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">They examine the mugs&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But no! no such thing;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">They can't find <span class="smcap">the ring</span>!</span><br />
And the Abbot declared that "when nobody twigged it,<br />
Some rascal or other had popped in and prigged it."<br />
<br />
The Cardinal rose with a dignified look,<br />
He called for his candle, his bell, and his book!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In holy anger and pious grief,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He solemnly cursed that rascally thief!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He cursed him at board, he cursed him in bed;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He cursed him in sleeping, that every night</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He should dream of the devil, and wake in a fright;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He cursed him in eating, he cursed him in drinking,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He cursed him in coughing, in sneezing, in winking;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He cursed him in sitting, in standing, in lying;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He cursed him in walking, in riding, in flying;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He cursed him in living, he cursed him in dying!&mdash;</span><br />
Never was heard such a terrible curse!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But, what gave rise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To no little surprise,</span><br />
Nobody seemed one penny the worse!<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg&nbsp;589]</a></span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The day was gone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The night came on,</span><br />
The monks and the friars they searched till dawn;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">When the Sacristan saw,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">On crumpled claw,</span><br />
Come limping a poor little lame Jackdaw;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">No longer gay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">As on yesterday;</span><br />
His feathers all seemed to be turned the wrong way;<br />
His pinions drooped, he could hardly stand,<br />
His head was as bald as the palm of your hand;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His eye so dim,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">So wasted each limb,</span><br />
That, heedless of grammar, they all cried "<span class="smcap">That's him</span>!<br />
That's the scamp that has done this scandalous thing!<br />
That's the thief that has got my Lord Cardinal's ring!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The poor little Jackdaw,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">When the monks he saw,</span><br />
Feebly gave vent to the ghost of a caw,<br />
And turned his bald head, as much as to say,<br />
"Pray be so good as to walk this way!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Slower and slower</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He limped on before,</span><br />
Till they came to the back of the belfry door,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where the first thing they saw,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Midst the sticks and the straw,</span><br />
Was the <span class="smcap">ring</span> in the nest of that little Jackdaw!<br />
<br />
Then the great Lord Cardinal called for his book,<br />
And off that terrible curse he took;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The mute expression</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Served in lieu of confession,</span><br />
And, being thus coupled with full restitution,<br />
The Jackdaw got plenary absolution!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">When these words were heard,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That poor little bird</span><br />
Was so changed in a moment, 'twas really absurd;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He grew sleek and fat;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In addition to that,</span><br />
A fresh crop of feathers came thick as a mat!<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg&nbsp;590]</a></span>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His tail waggled more</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Even than before;</span><br />
But no longer it wagged with an impudent air,<br />
No longer he perched on the Cardinal's chair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He hopped now about</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With a gait devout;</span><br />
At matins, at vespers, he never was out;<br />
And, so far from any more pilfering deeds,<br />
He always seemed telling the Confessor's beads.<br />
<br />
If any one lied, or if any one swore,<br />
Or slumbered in prayer-time and happened to snore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That good Jackdaw</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Would give a great "Caw!"</span><br />
As much as to say, "Don't do so any more!"<br />
While many remarked, as his manners they saw,<br />
That they "never had known such a pious Jackdaw!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He long lived the pride</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of that country side,</span><br />
And at last in the odour of sanctity died;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">When, as words were too faint</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His merits to paint,</span><br />
The Conclave determined to make him a Saint;<br />
And on newly-made Saints and Popes, as you know,<br />
It's the custom, at Rome, new names to bestow,<br />
So they canonised him by the name of Jim Crow!<br />

<h3>THE KNIGHT AND THE LADY</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
The Lady Jane was tall and slim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The Lady Jane was fair</span><br />
And Sir Thomas, her lord, was stout of limb,<br />
And his cough was short, and his eyes were dim,<br />
And he wore green "specs" with a tortoise shell rim,<br />
And his hat was remarkably broad in the brim,<br />
And she was uncommonly fond of him&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And they were a loving pair!</span><br />
And wherever they went, or wherever they came,<br />
Every one hailed them with loudest acclaim;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg&nbsp;591]</a></span>

<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Far and wide,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The people cried,</span><br />
All sorts of pleasure, and no sort of pain,<br />
To Sir Thomas the good, and the fair Lady Janel<br />
<br />
Now Sir Thomas the good, be it well understood,<br />
Was a man of very contemplative mood&mdash;<br />
He would pour by the hour, o'er a weed or a flower,<br />
Or the slugs, that came crawling out after a shower;<br />
Black beetles, bumble-bees, blue-bottle flies,<br />
And moths, were of no small account in his eyes;<br />
An "industrious flea," he'd by no means despise,<br />
While an "old daddy long-legs," whose long legs and thighs<br />
Passed the common in shape, or in color, or size,<br />
He was wont to consider an absolute prize.<br />
Giving up, in short, both business and sport, he<br />
Abandoned himself, <i>tout entier</i>, to philosophy.<br />
<br />
Now as Lady Jane was tall and slim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And Lady Jane was fair.</span><br />
And a good many years the junior of him,<br />
There are some might be found entertaining a notion,<br />
That such an entire, and exclusive devotion,<br />
To that part of science, folks style entomology,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Was a positive shame,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And, to such a fair dame,</span><br />
Really demanded some sort of apology;<br />
Ever poking his nose into this, and to that&mdash;<br />
At a gnat, or a bat, or a cat, or a rat,<br />
At great ugly things, all legs and wings,<br />
With nasty long tails, armed with nasty long stings<br />
And eternally thinking, and blinking, and winking,<br />
At grubs&mdash;when he ought of <i>her</i> to be thinking.<br />
But no! ah no! 'twas by no means so<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">With the fair Lady Jane,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>Tout au contraire</i>, no lady so fair,</span><br />
Was e'er known to wear more contented an air;<br />
And&mdash;let who would call&mdash;every day she was there<br />
Propounding receipts for some delicate fare,<br />
Some toothsome conserve, of quince, apple or pear<br />
Or distilling strong waters&mdash;or potting a hare&mdash;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg&nbsp;592]</a></span>

Or counting her spoons, and her crockery ware;<br />
Enough to make less gifted visitors stare.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Nay more; don't suppose</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">With such doings as those</span><br />
This account of her merits must come to a close;<br />
No!&mdash;examine her conduct more closely, you'll find<br />
She by no means neglected improving her mind;<br />
For there all the while with an air quite bewitching<br />
She sat herring-boning, tambouring, or stitching,<br />
Or having an eye to affairs of the kitchen.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Close by her side,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sat her kinsman, MacBride&mdash;</span><br />
Captain Dugald MacBride, Royal Scots Fusiliers;&mdash;<br />
And I doubt if you'd find, in the whole of his clan,<br />
A more highly intelligent, worthy young man;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And there he'd be sitting,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">While she was a-knitting,</span><br />
Reading aloud, with a very grave look,<br />
Some very "wise saw," from some very good book&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">No matter who came,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">It was always the same,</span><br />
The Captain was reading aloud to the dame,<br />
Till, from having gone through half the books on the shelf,<br />
They were <i>almost</i> as wise as Sir Thomas himself.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Well it happened one day&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">I really can't say</span><br />
The particular month;&mdash;but I <i>think</i> 'twas in May,<br />
'Twas I <i>know</i> in the spring-time, when "nature looks gay,"<br />
As the poet observes&mdash;and on tree-top and spray,<br />
The dear little dickey birds carol away,<br />
That the whole of the house was thrown into affright,<br />
For no soul could conceive what was gone with the Knight.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">It seems he had taken</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">A light breakfast&mdash;bacon,</span><br />
An egg, a little broiled haddock&mdash;at most<br />
A round and a half of some hot buttered toast,<br />
With a slice of cold sirloin from yesterday's roast.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg&nbsp;593]</a></span>

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And then, let me see,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">He had two,&mdash;perhaps three</span><br />
Cups, with sugar and cream, of strong gunpowder tea,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">But no matter for that&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">He had called for his hat,</span><br />
With the brim that I've said was so broad and so flat,<br />
And his "specs" with the tortoise-shell rim, and his cane.<br />
With the crutch-handled top, which he used to sustain<br />
His steps in his walk, or to poke in the shrubs<br />
Or the grass, when unearthing his worms or his grubs;<br />
Thus armed he set out on a ramble&mdash;a-lack!<br />
He <i>set out</i>, poor dear soul!&mdash;but he never came back!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"First dinner bell" rang</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Out its euphonous clang</span><br />
At five&mdash;folks kept early hours then&mdash;and the "last"<br />
Ding-donged, as it ever was wont, at half-past.<br />
Still the master was absent&mdash;the cook came and said, he<br />
Feared dinner would spoil, having been so long ready,<br />
That the puddings her ladyship thought such a treat<br />
He was morally sure, would be scarce fit to eat!<br />
Said the lady, "Dish up! Let the meal be served straight,<br />
And let two or three slices be put on a plate,<br />
And kept hot for Sir Thomas."&mdash;Captain Dugald said grace,<br />
Then set himself down in Sir Thomas' place.<br />
<br />
Wearily, wearily, all that night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That live-long night did the hours go by;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And the Lady Jane,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In grief and pain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She sat herself down to cry!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And Captain MacBride,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Who sat by her side,</span><br />
Though I really can't say that he actually cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At least had a tear in his eye!</span><br />
As much as can well be expected, perhaps,<br />
From "very young fellows," for very "old chaps."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And if he had said</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">What he'd got in his head,</span><br />
'Twould have been, "Poor old Duffer, he's certainly dead!"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg&nbsp;594]</a></span>

The morning dawned&mdash;and the next&mdash;and the next<br />
And all in the mansion were still perplexed;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">No knocker fell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">His approach to tell;</span><br />
Not so much as a runaway ring at the bell.<br />
<br />
Yet the sun shone bright upon tower and tree,<br />
And the meads smiled green as green may be,<br />
And the dear little dickey birds caroled with glee,<br />
And the lambs in the park skipped merry and free.&mdash;<br />
Without, all was joy and harmony!<br />
<br />
And thus 'twill be&mdash;nor long the day&mdash;<br />
Ere we, like him, shall pass away!<br />
Yon sun that now our bosoms warms,<br />
Shall shine&mdash;but shine on other forms;<br />
Yon grove, whose choir so sweetly cheers<br />
Us now, shall sound on other ears;<br />
The joyous lambs, as now, shall play,<br />
But other eyes its sports survey;<br />
The stream we loved shall roll as fair,<br />
The flowery sweets, the trim parterre,<br />
Shall scent, as now, the ambient air;<br />
The tree whose bending branches bear<br />
The one loved name&mdash;shall yet be there&mdash;<br />
But where the hand that carved it? Where?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">These were hinted to me as the very ideas</span><br />
Which passed through the mind of the fair Lady Jane,<br />
As she walked on the esplanade to and again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">With Captain MacBride,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Of course at her side,</span><br />
Who could not look <i>quite</i> so forlorn&mdash;though he tried,<br />
An "idea" in fact, had got into <i>his</i> head,<br />
That if "poor dear Sir Thomas" should really be dead,<br />
It might be no bad "spec" to be there in his stead,<br />
And by simply contriving, in due time, to wed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">A lady who was young and fair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">A lady slim and tall,</span><br />
To set himself down in comfort there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The lord of Tapton Hall.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg&nbsp;595]</a></span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Thinks he, "We have sent</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Half over Kent,</span><br />
And nobody knows how much money's been spent,<br />
Yet no one's been found to say which way he went!<br />
Here's a fortnight and more has gone by, and we've tried<br />
Every plan we could hit on&mdash;and had him well cried<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">'<span class="smcap">Missing</span>!! <i>Stolen or Strayed</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>Lost or Mislaid</i>,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">A Gentleman</span>;&mdash;middle-aged, sober and staid;<br />
Stoops slightly;&mdash;and when he left home was arrayed<br />
In a sad-colored suit, somewhat dingy and frayed;<br />
Had spectacles on with a tortoise-shell rim,<br />
And a hat rather low crowned, and broad in the brim.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Whoe'er shall bear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Or send him with care,</span><br />
(Right side uppermost) home; or shall give notice where<br />
Said middle-aged <span class="smcap">Gentleman</span> is; or shall state<br />
Any fact, that may tend to throw light on his fate,<br />
To the man at the turnpike, called <i>Tappington Gate</i>,<br />
Shall receive a reward of <i>Five Pounds</i> for his trouble.<br />
N.B. If defunct, the <i>Reward</i> will be double!!'<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Had he been above ground,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">He <i>must</i> have been found.</span><br />
No; doubtless he's shot&mdash;or he's hanged&mdash;or he's drowned!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Then his widow&mdash;ay! ay!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">But what will folks say?&mdash;</span><br />
To address her at once, at so early a day.<br />
Well&mdash;what then&mdash;who cares!&mdash;let 'em say what they may."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">When a man has decided</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">As Captain MacBride did,</span><br />
And once fully made up his mind on the matter, he<br />
Can't be too prompt in unmasking his battery.<br />
He began on the instant, and vowed that her eyes<br />
Far exceeded in brilliance the stars in the skies;<br />
That her lips were like roses, her cheeks were like lilies;<br />
Her breath had the odor of daffadowndillies!&mdash;<br />
With a thousand more compliments, equally true,<br />
Expressed in similitudes equally new!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Then his left arm he placed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Round her jimp, taper waist&mdash;</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg&nbsp;596]</a></span>

<br />
Ere she fixed to repulse or return his embrace,<br />
Up came running a man at a deuce of a pace,<br />
With that very peculiar expression of face<br />
Which always betokens dismay or disaster,<br />
Crying out&mdash;'twas the gard'ner&mdash;"Oh, ma'am! we've found master!!"<br />
"Where! where?" screamed the lady; and echo screamed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Where?"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The man couldn't say "there!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He had no breath to spare,</span><br />
But gasping for breath he could only respond<br />
By pointing&mdash;be pointed, alas! <span class="smcap">TO THE POND</span>.<br />
'Twas e'en so; poor dear Knight, with his "specs" and his hat,<br />
He'd gone poking his nose into this and to that;<br />
When close to the side of the bank, he espied<br />
An uncommon fine tadpole, remarkably fat!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He stooped;&mdash;and he thought her</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His own;&mdash;he had caught her!</span><br />
Got hold of her tail&mdash;and to land almost brought her,<br />
When&mdash;he plumped head and heels into fifteen feet water!<br />
<br />
The Lady Jane was tall and slim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The Lady Jane was fair,</span><br />
Alas! for Sir Thomas!&mdash;she grieved for him,<br />
As she saw two serving men sturdy of limb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His body between them bear;</span><br />
She sobbed and she sighed, she lamented and cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For of sorrow brimful was her cup;</span><br />
She swooned, and I think she'd have fallen down and died,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">If Captain MacBride</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Hadn't been by her side</span><br />
With the gardener;&mdash;they both their assistance supplied,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And managed to hold her up.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But when she "comes to,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Oh! 'tis shocking to view</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sight which the corpse reveals!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Sir Thomas' body,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">It looked so odd&mdash;he</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was half eaten up by the eels!</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg&nbsp;597]</a></span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">His waistcoat and hose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And the rest of his clothes,</span><br />
Were all gnawed through and through;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And out of each shoe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">An eel they drew;</span><br />
And from each of his pockets they pulled out two!<br />
And the gardener himself had secreted a few,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">As well might be supposed he'd do,</span><br />
For, when he came running to give the alarm,<br />
He had six in the basket that hung on his arm.<br />
<br />
Good Father John was summoned anon;<br />
Holy water was sprinkled and little bells tinkled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And tapers were lighted,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And incense ignited,</span><br />
And masses were sung, and masses were said,<br />
All day, for the quiet repose of the dead,<br />
And all night no one thought about going to bed.<br />
<br />
But Lady Jane was tall and slim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And Lady Jane was fair,</span><br />
And ere morning came, that winsome dame<br />
Had made up her mind, or&mdash;what's much the same&mdash;<br />
Had <i>thought about</i>, once more "changing her name,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And she said with a pensive air,</span><br />
To Thompson the valet, while taking away,<br />
When supper was over, the cloth and the tray,<br />
"Eels a many I've ate; but any<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">So good ne'er tasted before!&mdash;</span><br />
They're a fish too, of which I'm remarkably fond&mdash;<br />
Go&mdash;pop Sir Thomas again in the pond&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Poor dear!&mdash;<i>he'll catch us some more</i>."</span><br />
</p>
<p class='h_5'>MORAL</p>
<p>
All middle-aged gentlemen let me advise,<br />
If you're married, and hav'n't got very good eyes,<br />
Don't go poking about after blue-bottle flies.<br />
If you've spectacles, don't have a tortoise-shell rim,<br />
And don't go near the water&mdash;unless you can swim.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg&nbsp;598]</a></span>

Married ladies, especially such as are fair,<br />
Tall and slim, I would next recommend to beware,<br />
How, on losing one spouse, they give way to despair,<br />
But let them reflect, there are fish, and no doubt on't,<br />
As good <i>in</i> the river, as ever came <i>out</i> on't.<br />

<h3>AN EASTERN QUESTION</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
My William was a soldier, and he says to me, says he,<br />
"My Susan, I must sail across the South Pacific sea;<br />
For we've got to go to Egypt for to fight the old Khedive;<br />
But when he's dead I'll marry you, as sure as I'm alive!"<br />
<br />
'Twere hard for me to part with him; he couldn't read nor write,<br />
So I never had love letters for to keep my memory bright;<br />
But Jim, who is our footman, took the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>,<br />
And told me William's reg-i-ment mowed down the foe like chaff.<br />
<br />
So every day Jim come to me to read the Eastern news,<br />
And used to bring me bouquets, which I scarcely could refuse;<br />
Till one fine day it happened&mdash;<i>how</i> it happened, goodness knows,&mdash;<br />
He put his arm around me and he started to propose.<br />
<br />
I put his hand from off me, and I said in thrilling tones,<br />
"I like you, Jim, but <i>never</i> will I give up William Jones;<br />
It ain't no good your talking, for my heart is firm and fixed,<br />
For William is engaged to me, and naught shall come betwixt."<br />
<br />
So Jim he turned a ghastly pale to find there was no hope;<br />
And made remarks about a pond, and razors, and a rope;<br />
The other servants pitied him, and Rosie said as much;<br />
But Rosie was too flighty, and he didn't care for such.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg&nbsp;599]</a></span>
<br />
The weeks and months passed slowly, till I heard the Eastern war<br />
Was over, and my William would soon be home once more;<br />
And I was proud and happy for I knew that I could say<br />
I'd been true to my sweet William all the years he'd been away.<br />
<br />
Says Jim to me, "I love you, Sue, you know full well I do,<br />
And evermore whilst I draw breath I vow I will be true;<br />
But my feelings are too sensitive, I really couldn't stand<br />
A-seeing of that soldier taking hold your little hand.<br />
<br />
"So I've made my mind up finally to throw myself away;<br />
There's Rosie loves me truly, and no more I'll say her nay;<br />
I've bought a hat on purpose, and I'm going to hire a ring,<br />
And I've borrowed father's wedding suit that looks the very thing."<br />
<br />
So Jim he married Rosie, just the very day before<br />
My William's reg-i-ment was due to reach their native shore;<br />
I was there to see him landed and to give him welcome home,<br />
And take him to my arms from which he never more should roam.<br />
<br />
But I couldn't see my William, for the men were all alike,<br />
With their red coats and their rifles, and their helmets with a spike;<br />
So I curtseys to a sergeant who was smiling very kind,<br />
"Where's William Jones?" I asks him, "if so be you wouldn't mind?"<br />
<br />
Then he calls a gawky, red-haired chap, that stood good six-feet two:<br />
"Here, Jones," he cries, "this lady here's enquiring after you."<br />
"Not me!" I says, "I want a man who 'listed from our Square;<br />
With a small moustache, but growing fast, and bright brown curly hair."<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg&nbsp;600]</a></span>
<br />
The sergeant wiped his eye, and took his helmet from his head,<br />
"I'm very sorry, ma'am," he said, "<i>that</i> William Jones is dead;<br />
He died from getting sunstroke, and we envied him his lot,<br />
For we were melted to our bones, the climate was that hot!"<br />
<br />
So that's how 'tis that I'm condemned to lead a single life,<br />
For the sergeant, who was struck with me, already had a wife;<br />
And Jim is tied to Rosie, and can't get himself untied,<br />
Whilst the man that I was faithful to has been and gone and died!<br />

<h3>MY AUNT'S SPECTRE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
They tell me (but I really can't<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Imagine such a rum thing),</span><br />
<span class="smcap">It</span> is the phantom of my Aunt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who ran away&mdash;or something.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">It</span> is the very worst of bores:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(My Aunt was most delightful).</span><br />
<span class="smcap">It</span> prowls about the corridors,<br />

<br />
At midnight through the rooms <span class="smcap">It</span> glides,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Behaving very coolly,</span><br />
Our hearts all throb against our sides&mdash;<br />

<br />
Yes, that's her portrait on the wall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In quaint old-fangled bodice:</span><br />
Her eyes are blue&mdash;her waist is small&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A ghost! Pooh, pooh,&mdash;a goddess!</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg&nbsp;601]</a></span>

<br />
A fine patrician shape, to suit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My dear old father's sister&mdash;</span><br />
Lips softly curved, a dainty foot:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Happy the man that kissed her!</span><br />
<br />
Light hair of crisp irregular curl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over fair shoulders scattered&mdash;</span><br />
Egad, she was a pretty girl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unless Sir Thomas flattered!</span><br />
<br />
And who the deuce, in these bright days,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could possibly expect her</span><br />
To take to dissipated ways,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And plague us as a spectre?</span><br />

<h3>CASEY AT THE BAT</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
It looked extremely rocky for the Mudville nine that day,<br />
The score stood four to six with but an inning left to play.<br />
And so, when Cooney died at first, and Burrows did the same,<br />
A pallor wreathed the features of the patrons of the game.<br />
A straggling few got up to go, leaving there the rest,<br />
With that hope which springs eternal within the human breast.<br />
For they thought if only Casey could get a whack at that,<br />
They'd put up even money with Casey at the bat.<br />
But Flynn preceded Casey, and likewise so did Blake,<br />
And the former was a pudding and the latter was a fake;<br />
So on that stricken multitude a death-like silence sat,<br />
For there seemed but little chance of Casey's getting to the bat.<br />
But Flynn let drive a single to the wonderment of all,<br />
And the much despis&egrave;d Blakey tore the cover off the ball,<br />
And when the dust had lifted and they saw what had occurred,<br />
There was Blakey safe on second, and Flynn a-hugging third.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg&nbsp;602]</a></span>

Then from the gladdened multitude went up a joyous yell,<br />
It bounded from the mountain top and rattled in the dell,<br />
It struck upon the hillside, and rebounded on the flat,<br />
For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.<br />
There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place,<br />
There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile on Casey's face,<br />
And when responding to the cheers he lightly doffed his hat,<br />
No stranger in the crowd could doubt, 'twas Casey at the bat.<br />
Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt,<br />
Five thousand tongues applauded as he wiped them on his shirt;<br />
And while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip&mdash;<br />
Defiance gleamed from Casey's eye&mdash;a sneer curled Casey's lip.<br />
And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,<br />
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there;<br />
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped&mdash;<br />
"That hain't my style," said Casey&mdash;"Strike one," the Umpire said.<br />
From the bleachers black with people there rose a sullen roar,<br />
Like the beating of the storm waves on a stern and distant shore,<br />
"Kill him! kill the Umpire!" shouted some one from the stand&mdash;<br />
And it's likely they'd have done it had not Casey raised his hand.<br />
With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone,<br />
He stilled the rising tumult and he bade the game go on;<br />
He signalled to the pitcher and again the spheroid flew,<br />
But Casey still ignored it and the Umpire said "Strike two."<br />
"Fraud!" yelled the maddened thousands, and the echo answered "Fraud,"<br />
But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg&nbsp;603]</a></span>

They saw his face grow stern and cold; they saw his muscles strain,<br />
And they knew that Casey would not let that ball go by again.<br />
The sneer is gone from Casey's lip; his teeth are clenched with hate,<br />
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;<br />
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,<br />
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.<br />
Oh! somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright,<br />
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,<br />
And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;<br />
But there is no joy in Mudville&mdash;mighty Casey has "Struck Out."<br />

<h3>THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hamelin Town's in Brunswick,</span><br />
By famous Hanover City;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The river Weser, deep and wide,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Washes its wall on the southern side;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A pleasanter spot you never spied;</span><br />
But when begins my ditty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Almost five hundred years ago,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To see the townsfolk suffer so</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From vermin was a pity.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rats!</span><br />
They fought the dogs, and killed the cats,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bit the babies in the cradles,</span><br />
And ate the cheeses out of the vats,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Split open the kegs of salted sprats,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And even spoiled the women's chats,</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg&nbsp;604]</a></span>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By drowning their speaking</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With shrieking and squeaking</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In fifty different sharps and flats.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last the people in a body</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To the Town Hall came flocking:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Tis clear," cried they, "our Mayor's a noddy;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And as for our Corporation&mdash;shocking</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To think we buy gowns lined with ermine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For dolts that can't or won't determine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What's best to rid us of our vermin!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You hope, because you're old and obese,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To find in the furry civic robe ease?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rouse up, Sirs! Give your brains a racking</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To find the remedy we're lacking,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!"</span><br />
At this the Mayor and Corporation<br />
Quaked with a mighty consternation.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An hour they sate in council,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At length the Mayor broke silence:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I wish I were a mile hence!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It's easy to bid one rack one's brain&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'm sure my poor head aches again</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've scratched it so, and all in vain.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, for a trap, a trap, a trap!"</span><br />
<br />
Just as he said this, what should hap<br />
At the chamber door but a gentle tap?<br />
"Bless us," cried the Mayor, "what's that?"<br />
(With the Corporation as he sat,<br />
Looking little though wondrous fat;<br />
Nor brighter was his eye, nor moister,<br />
Than a too-long-opened oyster,<br />
Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous<br />
For a plate of turtle green and glutinous),<br />
"Only a scraping of shoes on the mat?<br />
Anything like the sound of a rat<br />
Makes my heart go pit-a-pat!"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg&nbsp;605]</a></span>
<br />
"Come in!"&mdash;the Mayor cried, looking bigger:<br />
And in did come the strangest figure.<br />
His queer long coat from heel to head<br />
Was half of yellow and half of red;<br />
And he himself was tall and thin,<br />
With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,<br />
And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,<br />
No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,<br />
But lips where smiles went out and in;<br />
There was no guessing his kith and kin:<br />
And nobody could enough admire<br />
The tall man and his quaint attire.<br />
Quoth one: "It's as my great grandsire,<br />
Starting up at the Trump of Doom's tone,<br />
Had walked this way from his painted tombstone!"<br />
<br />
He advanced to the council-table;<br />
And, "Please your honours," said he, "I'm able,<br />
By means of a secret charm, to draw<br />
All creatures living beneath the sun,<br />
That creep or swim or fly or run,<br />
After me so as you never saw!<br />
And I chiefly use my charm<br />
On creatures that do people harm,<br />
The mole and toad and newt and viper;<br />
And people call me the Pied Piper."<br />
(And here they noticed round his neck<br />
A scarf of red and yellow stripe,<br />
To match with his coat of the selfsame cheque;<br />
And at the scarf's end hung a pipe;<br />
And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying<br />
As if impatient to be playing<br />
Upon this pipe, as low it dangled<br />
Over his vesture so old-fangled.)<br />
"Yet," said he, "poor piper as I am,<br />
In Tartary I freed the Cham,<br />
Last June, from his huge swarms of gnats;<br />
I eased in Asia the Nizam<br />
Of a monstrous brood of vampyre bats:<br />
And as for what your brain bewilders,<br />
If I can rid your town of rats,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg&nbsp;606]</a></span>

Will you give me a thousand guilders?"<br />
"One? fifty thousand!" was the exclamation<br />
Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.<br />
<br />
Into the street the Piper stept,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smiling first a little smile,</span><br />
As if he knew what magic slept<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In his quiet pipe the while;</span><br />
Then, like a musical adept,<br />
To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,<br />
And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled<br />
Like a candle flame where salt is sprinkled;<br />
And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,<br />
You heard as if an army muttered;<br />
And the muttering grew to a grumbling;<br />
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;<br />
And out of the house the rats came tumbling.<br />
Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,<br />
Brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats,<br />
Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,</span><br />
Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Families by tens and dozens,</span><br />
Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives&mdash;<br />
Followed the Piper for their lives.<br />
From street to street he piped advancing,<br />
And step by step they followed dancing,<br />
Until they came to the river Weser<br />
Wherein all plunged and perished<br />
&mdash;Save one, who, stout as Julius C&aelig;sar,<br />
Swam across and lived to carry<br />
(As he the manuscript he cherished)<br />
To Rat-land home his commentary,<br />
Which was, "At the first shrill notes of the pipe,<br />
I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,<br />
And putting apples wondrous ripe,<br />
Into a cider-press's gripe:<br />
And a moving away of pickle-tub boards,<br />
And a leaving ajar of conserve cupboards,<br />
And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,<br />
And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks:<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg&nbsp;607]</a></span>
<br />
And it seemed as if a voice<br />
(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery<br />
Is breathed) called out, Oh rats, rejoice!<br />
The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!<br />
So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,<br />
Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!<br />
And just as a bulky sugar puncheon,<br />
All ready staved, like a great sun shone<br />
Glorious scarce an inch before me,<br />
Just as methought it said, Come, bore me!<br />
&mdash;I found the Weser rolling o'er me."<br />
<br />
You should have heard the Hamelin people<br />
Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple.<br />
"Go," cried the Mayor, "and get long poles!<br />
Poke out the nests and block up the holes!<br />
Consult with carpenters and builders,<br />
And leave in our town not even a trace<br />
Of the rats!"&mdash;when suddenly, up the face<br />
Of the piper perked in the market-place,<br />
With a "First, if you please, my thousand guilders!"<br />
<br />
A thousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue;<br />
So did the Corporation too.<br />
For council dinners made rare havock<br />
With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock;<br />
And half the money would replenish<br />
Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish.<br />
To pay this sum to a wandering fellow<br />
With a gipsy coat of red and yellow!<br />
"Beside," quoth the Mayor with a knowing wink,<br />
"Our business was done at the river's brink;<br />
We saw with our eyes the vermin sink,<br />
And what's dead can't come to life, I think.<br />
So, friend, we're not the folks to shrink<br />
From the duty of giving you something to drink,<br />
And a matter of money to put in your poke;<br />
But as for the guilders, what we spoke<br />
Of them, as you very well know, was in joke;<br />
Beside, our losses have made us thrifty:<br />
A thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg&nbsp;608]</a></span>
<br />
The Piper's face fell, and he cried,<br />
"No trifling! I can't wait, beside!<br />
I've promised to visit by dinner time<br />
Bagdad, and accept the prime<br />
Of the Head Cook's pottage, all he's rich in,<br />
For having left in the Caliph's kitchen,<br />
Of a nest of scorpions no survivor:<br />
With him I proved no bargain-driver,<br />
With you, don't think I'll bate a stiver!<br />
And folks who put me in a passion<br />
May find me pipe after another fashion."<br />
<br />
"How?" cried the Mayor, "d'ye think I'll brook<br />
Being worse treated than a Cook?<br />
Insulted by a lazy ribald<br />
With idle pipe and vesture piebald?<br />
You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst,<br />
Blow your pipe there till you burst!"<br />
<br />
Once more he stept into the street;<br />
And to his lips again<br />
Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane;<br />
And ere he blew three notes (such sweet<br />
Soft notes as yet musician's cunning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never gave the enraptured air),</span><br />
There was a rustling, that seemed like a bustling<br />
Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling,<br />
Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,<br />
Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering,<br />
And, like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering,<br />
Out came the children running.<br />
All the little boys and girls,<br />
With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls<br />
And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,<br />
Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after<br />
The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.<br />
<br />
The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood<br />
As if they were changed into blocks of wood,<br />
Unable to move a step, or cry<br />
To the children merrily skipping by,<br />
And could only follow with the eye<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg&nbsp;609]</a></span>
<br />
That joyous crowd at the Piper's back.<br />
But how the Mayor was on the rack,<br />
And the wretched Council's bosoms beat,<br />
As the Piper turned from the High Street<br />
To where the Weser rolled its waters<br />
Right in the way of their sons and daughters!<br />
However he turned from South to West,<br />
And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,<br />
And after him the children pressed;<br />
Great was the joy in every breast.<br />
"He never can cross that mighty top!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's forced to let the piping drop,</span><br />
And we shall see our children stop!"<br />
When, lo, as they reached the mountain's side,<br />
A wondrous portal opened wide,<br />
As if a cavern were suddenly hollowed;<br />
And the Piper advanced and the children followed,<br />
And when all were in to the very last,<br />
The door in the mountain-side shut fast.<br />
Did I say&mdash;all? No! one was lame,<br />
And could not dance the whole of the way;<br />
And in after years, if you would blame<br />
His sadness, he was used to say,&mdash;<br />
"It's dull in our town since my playmates left;<br />
I can't forget that I'm bereft<br />
Of all the pleasant sights they see,<br />
Which the Piper also promised me;<br />
For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,<br />
Joining the town and just at hand,<br />
Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew,<br />
And flowers put forth a fairer hue,<br />
And everything was strange and new;<br />
The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,<br />
And their dogs outran our fallow deer,<br />
And honey-bees had lost their stings;<br />
And horses were born with eagle's wings;<br />
And just as I became assured<br />
My lame foot would be speedily cured,<br />
The music stopped, and I stood still,<br />
And found myself outside the Hill,<br />
Left alone against my will,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg&nbsp;610]</a></span>

To go now limping as before,<br />
And never hear of that country more!"<br />
<br />
Alas, alas, for Hamelin!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There came into many a burgher's pate</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A text which says, that Heaven's Gate</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Opes to the Rich at as easy rate</span><br />
As the needle's eye takes a camel in!<br />
The Mayor sent East, West, North, and South,<br />
To offer the Piper by word of mouth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wherever it was men's lot to find him,</span><br />
Silver and gold to his heart's content,<br />
If he'd only return the way he went,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bring the children all behind him.</span><br />
But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavour,<br />
And Piper and dancers were gone for ever,<br />
They made a decree that lawyers never<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should think their records dated duly</span><br />
If, after the day of the month and year,<br />
These words did not as well appear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And so long after what happened here</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the twenty-second of July,</span><br />
Thirteen hundred and seventy-six:"<br />
And the better in memory to fix<br />
The place of the Children's last retreat,<br />
They called it the Pied Piper's Street&mdash;<br />
Where any one playing on pipe or tabor<br />
Was sure for the future to lose his labour.<br />
Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To shock with mirth a street so solemn;</span><br />
But opposite the place of the cavern<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They wrote the story on a column.</span><br />
And on the great Church Window painted<br />
The same, to make the world acquainted<br />
How their children were stolen away,<br />
And there it stands to this very day.<br />
And I must not omit to say<br />
That in Transylvania there's a tribe<br />
Of alien people that ascribe<br />
The outlandish ways and dress,<br />
On which their neighbours lay such stress,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg&nbsp;611]</a></span>

To their fathers and mothers having risen<br />
Out of some subterraneous prison,<br />
Into which they were trepanned<br />
Long time ago in a mighty band<br />
Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick Land,<br />
But how or why, they don't understand.<br />
<br />
So, Willy, let me and you be wipers<br />
Of scores out with all men&mdash;especially pipers;<br />
And, whether they pipe us free from rats or from mice,<br />
If we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise.<br />

<h3>THE GOOSE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
I knew an old wife lean and poor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her rags scarce held together;</span><br />
There strode a stranger to the door,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it was windy weather.</span><br />
<br />
He held a goose upon his arm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He utter'd rhyme and reason,</span><br />
"Here, take the goose, and keep you warm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is a stormy season."</span><br />
<br />
She caught the white goose by the leg,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A goose&mdash;'twas no great matter.</span><br />
The goose let fall a golden egg<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With cackle and with clatter.</span><br />
<br />
She dropt the goose, and caught the pelf,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ran to tell her neighbours;</span><br />
And bless'd herself, and cursed herself,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rested from her labours.</span><br />
<br />
And feeding high, and living soft,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grew plump and able-bodied;</span><br />
Until the grave churchwarden doff'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The parson smirk'd and nodded.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg&nbsp;612]</a></span>

<br />
So sitting, served by man and maid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She felt her heart grow prouder:</span><br />
But, ah! the more the white goose laid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It clack'd and cackled louder.</span><br />
<br />
It clutter'd here, it chuckled there;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It stirr'd the old wife's mettle:</span><br />
She shifted in her elbow-chair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hurl'd the pan and kettle.</span><br />
<br />
"A quinsy choke thy cursed note!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then wax'd her anger stronger.</span><br />
"Go, take the goose, and wring her throat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I will not bear it longer."</span><br />
<br />
Then yelp'd the cur, and yawl'd the cat;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ran Gaffer, stumbled Gammer.</span><br />
The goose flew this way and flew that,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fill'd the house with clamour.</span><br />
<br />
As head and heels upon the floor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They flounder'd all together,</span><br />
There strode a stranger to the door,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it was windy weather:</span><br />
<br />
He took the goose upon his arm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He utter'd words of scorning;</span><br />
"So keep you cold, or keep you warm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is a stormy morning."</span><br />
<br />
The wild wind rang from park and plain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And round the attics rumbled,</span><br />
Till all the tables danced again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And half the chimneys tumbled.</span><br />
<br />
The glass blew in, the fire blew out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The blast was hard and harder.</span><br />
Her cap blew off, her gown blew up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a whirlwind clear'd the larder:</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg&nbsp;613]</a></span>

<br />
And while on all sides breaking loose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her household fled the danger,</span><br />
Quoth she, "The Devil take the goose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And God forget the stranger!"</span><br />

<h3>THE BALLAD OF CHARITY</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
It was in a pleasant deep&ocirc;, sequestered from the rain,<br />
That many weary passengers were waitin' for the train;<br />
Piles of quite expensive baggage, many a gorgeous portmant&oacute;,<br />
Ivory-handled umberellas made a most touristic show.<br />
<br />
Whereunto there came a person, very humble was his mien,<br />
Who took an observation of the interestin' scene;<br />
Closely scanned the umberellas, watched with joy the mighty trunks,<br />
And observed that all the people were securin' Pullman bunks:<br />
<br />
Who was followed shortly after by a most unhappy tramp,<br />
Upon whose features poverty had jounced her iron stamp;<br />
And to make a clear impression as bees sting you while they buzz,<br />
She had hit him rather harder than she generally does.<br />
<br />
For he was so awful ragged, and in parts so awful bare,<br />
That the folks were quite repulsioned to behold him begging there;<br />
And instead of drawing currency from out their pocket-books,<br />
They drew themselves asunder with aversionary looks.<br />
<br />
Sternly gazed the first newcomer on the unindulgent crowd,<br />
Then in tones which pierced the deep&ocirc; he solilicussed aloud:&mdash;<br />
"I hev trevelled o'er this cont'nent from Quebec to Bogot&aacute;w,<br />
But sech a set of scallawags as these I never saw.<br />
<br />
"Ye are wealthy, ye are gifted, ye have house and lands and rent,<br />
Yet unto a suff'rin' mortal ye will not donate a cent;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg&nbsp;614]</a></span>

Ye expend your missionaries to the heathen and the Jew,<br />
But there isn't any heathen that is half as small as you.<br />
<br />
"Ye are lucky&mdash;ye hev cheque-books and deeposits in the bank,<br />
And ye squanderate your money on the titled folks of rank;<br />
The onyx and the sardonyx upon your garments shine,<br />
An' ye drink at every dinner p'r'aps a dollar's wuth of wine.<br />
<br />
"Ye are goin' for the summer to the islands by the sea,<br />
Where it costs four dollars daily&mdash;setch is not for setch as me;<br />
Iv'ry-handled umberellas do not come into my plan,<br />
But I kin give a dollar to this suff'rin' fellow-man.<br />
<br />
"Hand-bags made of Rooshy leather are not truly at my call,<br />
Yet in the eyes of Mussy I am richer 'en you all,<br />
For I kin give a dollar wher' you dare not stand a dime,<br />
And never miss it nother, nor regret it ary time."<br />
<br />
Sayin' this he drew a wallet from the inner of his vest,<br />
And gave the tramp a daddy, which it was his level best;<br />
Other people havin' heard him soon to charity inclined&mdash;<br />
One giver soon makes twenty if you only get their wind.<br />
<br />
The first who gave the dollar led the other one about,<br />
And at every contribution he a-raised a joyful shout,<br />
Exclaimin' how 'twas noble to relieviate distress,<br />
And remarkin' that our duty is our present happiness.<br />
<br />
Thirty dollars altogether were collected by the tramp,<br />
When he bid 'em all good evenin' and went out into the damp,<br />
And was followed briefly after by the one who made the speech,<br />
And who showed by good example how to practise as to preach.<br />
<br />
Which soon around the corner the couple quickly met,<br />
And the tramp produced the specie for to liquidate his debt;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg&nbsp;615]</a></span>

And the man who did the preachin' took his twenty of the sum,<br />
Which you see that out of thirty left a tenner for the bum.<br />
<br />
And the couple passed the summer at Bar Harbor with the rest,<br />
Greatly changed in their appearance and most elegently dressed.<br />
Any fowl with change of feathers may a brilliant bird become:<br />
Oh, how hard is life for many! oh, how sweet it is for some!<br />

<h3>THE POST CAPTAIN</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
When they heard the Captain humming and beheld the dancing crew,<br />
On the "Royal Biddy" frigate was Sir Peter Bombazoo;<br />
His mind was full of music and his head was full of tunes,<br />
And he cheerfully exhibited on pleasant afternoons.<br />
<br />
He could whistle, on his fingers, an invigorating reel,<br />
And could imitate a piper on the handles of the wheel;<br />
He could play in double octaves, too, all up and down the rail,<br />
Or rattle off a rondo on the bottom of a pail.<br />
<br />
Then porters with their packages and bakers with their buns,<br />
And countesses in carriages and grenadiers with guns,<br />
And admirals and commodores arrived from near and far,<br />
To listen to the music of this entertaining tar.<br />
<br />
When they heard the Captain humming and beheld the dancing crew.<br />
The commodores severely said, "Why, this will never do!"<br />
And the admirals all hurried home, remarking, "This is most<br />
Extraordinary conduct for a captain at his post."<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg&nbsp;616]</a></span>
<br />
Then they sent some sailing-orders to Sir Peter, in a boat,<br />
And he did a little fifing on the edges of the note;<br />
But he read the sailing orders, as of course he had to do,<br />
And removed the "Royal Biddy" to the Bay of Boohgabooh.<br />
<br />
Now, Sir Peter took it kindly, but it's proper to explain<br />
He was sent to catch a pirate out upon the Spanish Main.<br />
And he played, with variations, an imaginary tune<br />
On the buttons of his waistcoat, like a jocular bassoon.<br />
<br />
Then a topman saw the pirate come a-sailing in the bay,<br />
And reported to the Captain in the ordinary way.<br />
"I'll receive him," said Sir Peter, "with a musical salute,"<br />
And he gave some imitations of a double-jointed flute.<br />
<br />
Then the Pirate cried derisively, "I've heard it done before!"<br />
And he hoisted up a banner emblematical of gore.<br />
But Sir Peter said serenely, "You may double-shot the guns<br />
While I sing my little ballad of 'The Butter on the Buns.'"<br />
<br />
Then the Pirate banged Sir Peter and Sir Peter banged him back,<br />
And they banged away together as they took another tack.<br />
Then Sir Peter said, politely, "You may board him, if you like,"<br />
And he played a little dirge upon the handle of a pike.<br />
<br />
Then the "Biddies" poured like hornets down upon the Pirate's deck<br />
And Sir Peter caught the Pirate and he took him by the neck,<br />
And remarked, "You must excuse me, but you acted like a brute<br />
When I gave my imitation of that double-jointed flute."<br />
<br />
So they took that wicked Pirate and they took his wicked crew,<br />
And tied them up with double knots in packages of two.<br />
And left them lying on their backs in rows upon the beach<br />
With a little bread and water within comfortable reach.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg&nbsp;617]</a></span>
<br />
Now the Pirate had a treasure (mostly silverware and gold),<br />
And Sir Peter took and stowed it in the bottom of his hold;<br />
And said, "I will retire on this cargo of doubloons,<br />
And each of you, my gallant crew, may have some silver spoons."<br />
<br />
Now commodores in coach-and-fours and corporals in cabs,<br />
And men with carts of pies and tarts and fishermen with crabs,<br />
And barristers with wigs, in gigs, still gather on the strand,<br />
But there isn't any music save a little German band.<br />

<h3>ROBINSON CRUSOE'S STORY</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The night was thick and hazy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the <i>Piccadilly Daisy</i></span><br />
Carried down the crew and captain in the sea;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I think the water drowned 'em,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For they never, never found 'em,</span><br />
And I know they didn't come ashore with me.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! 'twas very sad and lonely</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I found myself the only</span><br />
Population on this cultivated shore;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I've made a little tavern</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a rocky little cavern,</span><br />
And I sit and watch for people at the door.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I spent no time in looking</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a girl to do my cooking,</span><br />
As I'm quite a clever hand at making stews;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I had that fellow Friday</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just to keep the tavern tidy,</span><br />
And to put a Sunday polish on my shoes.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have a little garden</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I'm cultivating lard in,</span><br />
As the things I eat are rather tough and dry;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg&nbsp;618]</a></span>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For I live on toasted lizards,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Prickly pears and parrot gizzards,</span><br />
And I'm really very fond of beetle pie.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The clothes I had were furry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it made me fret and worry</span><br />
When I found the moths were eating off the hair;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I had to scrape and sand 'em,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I boiled 'em and I tanned 'em,</span><br />
Till I got the fine morocco suit I wear.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I sometimes seek diversion</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a family excursion,</span><br />
With the few domestic animals you see;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we take along a carrot</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As refreshment for the parrot,</span><br />
And a little can of jungleberry tea.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then we gather as we travel</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bits of moss and dirty gravel,</span><br />
And we chip off little specimens of stone;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we carry home as prizes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Funny bugs of handy sizes,</span><br />
Just to give the day a scientific tone.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If the roads are wet and muddy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We remain at home and study,&mdash;</span><br />
For the Goat is very clever at a sum,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Dog, instead of fighting</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Studies ornamental writing,</span><br />
While the Cat is taking lessons on the drum.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We retire at eleven,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we rise again at seven;</span><br />
And I wish to call attention, as I close,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the fact that all the scholars</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are correct about their collars,</span><br />
And particular in turning out their toes.<br />

<h3>BEN BLUFF</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Ben Bluff was a whaler, and many a day<br />
Had chased the huge fish about Baffin's old Bay;<br />
But time brought a change his diversion to spoil,<br />
And that was when Gas took the shine out of Oil.<br />
<br />
He turned up his nose at the fumes of the coke,<br />
And swore the whole scheme was a bottle of smoke;<br />
As to London, he briefly delivered his mind,<br />
"Sparma-city," said he,&mdash;but the city declined.<br />
<br />
So Ben cut his line in a sort of a huff,<br />
As soon as his whales had brought profits enough,&mdash;<br />
And hard by the Docks settled down for his life,<br />
But, true to his text, went to Wales for a wife.<br />
<br />
A big one she was, without figure or waist,<br />
More bulky than lovely, but that was his taste;<br />
In fat she was lapped from her sole to her crown,<br />
And, turned into oil, would have lighted a town.<br />
<br />
But Ben, like a whaler, was charmed with the match,<br />
And thought, very truly, his spouse a great catch;<br />
A flesh-and-blood emblem of Plenty and Peace,<br />
And would not have changed her for Helen of Greece!<br />
<br />
For Greenland was green in his memory still;<br />
He'd quitted his trade, but retained the good-will;<br />
And often when softened by bumbo and flip,<br />
Would cry till he blubbered about his old ship.<br />
<br />
No craft like the <i>Grampus</i> could work through a floe,<br />
What knots she could run, and what tons she could stow!<br />
And then that rich smell he preferred to the rose,<br />
By just nosing the hold without holding his nose.<br />
<br />
Now Ben he resolved, one fine Saturday night,<br />
A snug arctic circle of friends to invite;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg&nbsp;620]</a></span>

Old tars in the trade, who related old tales,<br />
And drank, and blew clouds that were "very like whales."<br />
<br />
Of course with their grog there was plenty of chat,<br />
Of canting, and flenching, and cutting up fat;<br />
And how gun-harpoons into fashion had got,<br />
And if they were meant for the gun-whale or not?<br />
<br />
At last they retired, and left Ben to his rest,<br />
By fancies cetaceous and drink well possessed,<br />
When, lo! as he lay by his partner in bed,<br />
He heard something blow through two holes in its head!<br />
<br />
"A start!" muttered Ben, in the <i>Grampus</i> afloat,<br />
And made but one jump from the deck to the boat!<br />
"Huzza! pull away for the blubber and bone,&mdash;<br />
I look on that whale as already my own!"<br />
<br />
Then groping about by the light of the moon,<br />
He soon laid his hand on his trusty harpoon;<br />
A moment he poised it, to send it more pat,<br />
And then made a plunge to imbed it in fat!<br />
<br />
"Starn all!" he sang out, "as you care for your lives,&mdash;<br />
Starn all! as you hope to return to your wives,&mdash;<br />
Stand by for the flurry! she throws up the foam!<br />
Well done, my old iron; I've sent you right home!"<br />
<br />
And scarce had he spoken, when lo! bolt upright<br />
The leviathan rose in a great sheet of white,<br />
And swiftly advanced for a fathom or two,<br />
As only a fish out of water could do.<br />
<br />
"Starn all!" echoed Ben, with a movement aback,<br />
But too slow to escape from the creature's attack;<br />
If flippers it had, they were furnished with nails,&mdash;<br />
"You willin, I'll teach you that women ain't whales!"<br />
<br />
"Avast!" shouted Ben, with a sort of a screech,<br />
"I've heard a whale spouting, but here is a speech!"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg&nbsp;621]</a></span>

"A-spouting, indeed!&mdash;very pretty," said she;<br />
"But it's you I'll blow up, not the froth of the sea!<br />
<br />
"To go to pretend to take <i>me</i> for a fish!<br />
You great polar bear&mdash;but I know what you wish;<br />
You're sick of a wife that your hankering balks,<br />
You want to go back to some young Esquimaux!"<br />
<br />
"O dearest," cried Ben, frightened out of his life,<br />
"Don't think I would go for to murder a wife<br />
I must long have bewailed!" But she only cried, "Stuff!"<br />
Don't name it, you brute, you've <i>be-whaled</i> me enough!"<br />
<br />
"Lord, Polly!" said Ben, "such a deed could I do?<br />
I'd rather have murdered all Wapping than you!<br />
Come, forgive what is past." "O you monster!" she cried,<br />
"It was none of your fault that it passed off one side!"<br />
<br />
However, at last she inclined to forgive;<br />
"But, Ben, take this warning as long as you live,&mdash;<br />
If the love of harpooning so strong must prevail,<br />
Take a whale for a wife,&mdash;not a wife for a whale!"<br />

<h3>THE PILGRIMS AND THE PEAS</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
A brace of sinners, for no good,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were order'd to the Virgin Mary's shrine,</span><br />
Who at Loretto dwelt, in wax, stone, wood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in a fair white wig look'd wondrous fine.</span><br />
<br />
Fifty long miles had those sad rogues to travel,<br />
With something in their shoes much worse than gravel;<br />
In short, their toes so gentle to amuse,<br />
The priest had order'd peas into their shoes:<br />
<br />
A nostrum, famous in old popish times,<br />
For purifying souls that stunk with crimes;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A sort of apostolic salt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which popish parsons for its powers exalt,</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg&nbsp;622]</a></span>

For keeping souls of sinners sweet,<br />
Just as our kitchen salt keeps meat.<br />
<br />
The knaves set off on the same day,<br />
Peas in their shoes, to go and pray:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But very different was their speed, I wot:</span><br />
One of the sinners gallop'd on,<br />
Swift as a bullet from a gun;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The other limp'd, as if he had been shot.</span><br />
<br />
One saw the Virgin soon&mdash;<i>peccavi</i> cried&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had his soul whitewash'd all so clever;</span><br />
Then home again he nimbly hied,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made fit with saints above to live forever.</span><br />
<br />
In coming back, however, let me say,<br />
He met his brother rogue about half-way,<br />
Hobbling, with outstretch'd arms and bended knees,<br />
Damning the souls and bodies of the peas;<br />
His eyes in tears, his cheeks and brow in sweat,<br />
Deep sympathizing with his groaning feet.<br />
<br />
"How now," the light-toed, white-wash'd pilgrim broke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You lazy lubber!"</span><br />
"Odds curse it!" cried the other, "'tis no joke;<br />
My feet, once hard as any rock,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are now as soft as blubber.</span><br />
<br />
"Excuse me, Virgin Mary, that I swear:<br />
As for Loretto, I shall not go there;<br />
No! to the Devil my sinful soul must go,<br />
For damme if I ha'n't lost every toe.<br />
But, brother sinner, pray explain<br />
How 'tis that you are not in pain?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What power hath work'd a wonder for your toes?</span><br />
Whilst I, just like a snail, am crawling,<br />
Now swearing, now on saints devoutly bawling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whilst not a rascal comes to ease my woes?</span><br />
<br />
"How is't that <i>you</i> can like a greyhound go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Merry as if that naught had happen'd, burn ye!"</span><br />
"Why," cried the other, grinning, "you must know,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg&nbsp;623]</a></span>

That, just before I ventured on my journey,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To walk a little more at ease,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I took the liberty to boil <i>my</i> peas."</span><br />

<h3>TAM O'SHANTER</h3>

When chapman billies leave the street,<br />
And drouthy neibors neibors meet,<br />
As market days are wearin' late,<br />

While we sit bousing at the nappy,<br />
And gettin' fou and unco happy,<br />
We thinkna on the lang Scots miles,<br />
The mosses, waters, slaps, and stiles,<br />
That lie between us and our hame,<br />
Whare sits our sulky sullen dame,<br />
Gathering her brows like gathering storm,<br />
Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.<br />
<br />
This truth fand honest Tam o'Shanter,<br />
As he frae Ayr ae night did canter<br />
(Auld Ayr, wham ne'er a town surpasses<br />
For honest men and bonny lasses).<br />
<br />
O Tam! hadst thou but been sae wise<br />
As ta'en thy ain wife Kate's advice!<br />

That every naig was ca'd a shoe on,<br />
The smith and thee gat roaring fou on;<br />
That at the Lord's house, even on Sunday,<br />
Thou drank wi' Kirkton Jean till Monday.<br />

Thou wouldst be found deep drown'd in Doon!<br />

Ah, gentle dames! it gars me greet<br />
To think how mony counsels sweet,<br />
How mony lengthen'd, sage advices,<br />
The husband frae the wife despises!<br />

But to our tale:&mdash;Ae market night,<br />
Tam had got planted unco right,<br />
Fast by an ingle, bleezing finely,<br />
Wi' reaming swats, that drank divinely;<br />
And at his elbow, Souter Johnny,<br />
His ancient, trusty, drouthy crony;<br />
Tam lo'ed him like a very brither&mdash;<br />
They had been fou for weeks thegither!<br />
The night drave on wi' sangs and clatter,<br />
And aye the ale was growing better:<br />
The landlady and Tam grew gracious,<br />
Wi' favours secret, sweet, and precious<br />
The Souter tauld his queerest stories,<br />
The landlord's laugh was ready chorus:<br />
The storm without might rair and rustle&mdash;<br />
Tam didna mind the storm a whistle.<br />
<br />
Care, mad to see a man sae happy,<br />
E'en drown'd himsel' amang the nappy!<br />
As bees flee hame wi' lades o' treasure,<br />
The minutes wing'd their way wi' pleasure;<br />
Kings may be blest, but Tam was glorious,<br />
O'er a' the ills o' life victorious!<br />
<br />
But pleasures are like poppies spread,<br />
You seize the flower, its bloom is shed!<br />
Or like the snowfall in the river,<br />
A moment white&mdash;then melts for ever;<br />
Or like the borealis race,<br />
That flit ere you can point their place<br />
Or like the rainbow's lovely form,<br />
Evanishing amid the storm.<br />
Nae man can tether time or tide;<br />
The hour approaches Tam maun ride;<br />

That dreary hour he mounts his beast in;<br />
And sic a night he taks the road in<br />
As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in.<br />
<br />
The wind blew as 'twad blawn its last;<br />
The rattling showers rose on the blast;<br />
The speedy gleams the darkness swallow'd;<br />
Loud, deep, and lang, the thunder bellow'd:<br />
That night, a child might understand<br />
The deil had business on his hand.<br />
<br />
Weel mounted on his grey mare Meg,<br />
A better never lifted leg,<br />
Tam skelpit on through dub and mire,<br />
Despising wind, and rain, and fire;<br />
Whiles holding fast his guid blue bonnet,<br />
Whiles crooning o'er some auld Scots sonnet;<br />
Whiles glowering round wi' prudent cares,<br />
Lest bogles catch him unawares:<br />
Kirk-Alloway was drawing nigh,<br />
Whare ghaists and houlets nightly cry.<br />
By this time he was 'cross the foord,<br />
Whare in the snaw the chapman smoor'd;<br />
And past the birks and meikle stane<br />
Whare drunken Charlie brak's neck-bane:<br />
And through the whins, and by the cairn<br />
Whare hunters fand the murder'd bairn;<br />
And near the thorn, aboon the well,<br />
Whare Mungo's mither hang'd hersel'.<br />
Before him Doon pours a' his floods;<br />
The doubling storm roars through the woods;<br />
The lightnings flash frae pole to pole;<br />
Near and more near the thunders roll;<br />
When, glimmering through the groaning trees,<br />
Kirk-Alloway seem'd in a bleeze;<br />
Through ilka bore the beams were glancing,<br />
And loud resounded mirth and dancing.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg&nbsp;626]</a></span>
<br />
Inspiring bold John Barleycorn!<br />
What dangers thou canst mak us scorn!<br />
Wi' tippenny, we fear nae evil;<br />
Wi' usquebae, we'll face the devil!&mdash;<br />
The swats sae ream'd in Tammie's noddle,<br />
Fair play, he cared na deils a boddle.<br />
But Maggie stood right sair astonish'd,<br />
Till, by the heel and hand admonish'd,<br />
She ventured forward on the light;<br />
And, wow! Tam saw an unco sight!<br />
Warlocks and witches in a dance;<br />
Nae cotillon brent-new frae France,<br />
But hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys, and reels,<br />
Put life and mettle i' their heels:<br />
At winnock-bunker, i' the east,<br />
There sat auld Nick, in shape o' beast;<br />
A towzie tyke, black, grim, and large,<br />
To gie them music was his charge;<br />
He screw'd the pipes, and gart them skirl,<br />
Till roof and rafters a' did dirl.<br />
Coffins stood round, like open presses,<br />
That shaw'd the dead in their last dresses;<br />
And by some devilish cantrip slight<br />
Each in its cauld hand held a light,&mdash;<br />
By which heroic Tam was able<br />
To note upon the haly table,<br />
A murderer's banes in gibbet airns;<br />
Twa span-lang, wee, unchristian bairns;<br />
A thief, new-cutted frae a rape,<br />
Wi' his last gasp his gab did gape;<br />
Five tomahawks, wi' bluid red-rusted;<br />
Five scimitars, wi' murder crusted;<br />
A garter, which a babe had strangled;<br />
A knife, a father's throat had mangled,<br />
Whom his ain son o' life bereft,<br />
The grey hairs yet stack to the heft:<br />
Wi' mair o' horrible and awfu',<br />
Which even to name wad be unlawfu'.<br />
<br />
As Tammie glower'd, amazed and curious<br />
The mirth and fun grew fast and furious<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg&nbsp;627]</a></span>

The piper loud and louder blew,<br />
The dancers quick and quicker flew;<br />
They reel'd, they set, they cross'd, they cleekit,<br />
Till ilka carlin swat and reekit,<br />
And coost her duddies to the wark,<br />
And linket at it in her sark.<br />
Now Tam! O Tam! had thae been queans,<br />
A' plump and strappin' in their teens,<br />
Their sarks, instead o' creeshie flannen,<br />
Been snaw-white seventeen-hunder linen!<br />
Thir breeks o' mine, my only pair,<br />
That ance were plush, o' guid blue hair,<br />
I wad hae gien them aff my hurdies,<br />
For ae blink o' the bonny burdies!<br />
<br />
But wither'd beldams, auld and droll,<br />
Rigwoodie hags, wad spean a foal,<br />
Lowpin' and flingin' on a cummock,<br />
I wonder didna turn thy stomach.<br />
<br />
But Tam kenn'd what was what fu' brawlie,<br />
"There was ae winsome wench and walie,"<br />
That night enlisted in the core<br />
(Lang after kenn'd on Carrick shore;<br />
For mony a beast to dead she shot,<br />
And perish'd money a bonny boat,<br />
And shook baith meikle corn and bear,<br />
And kept the country-side in fear).<br />
Her cutty sark, o' Paisley harn,<br />
That, while a lassie, she had worn,<br />
In longitude though sorely scanty,<br />
It was her best, and she was vauntie.<br />
<br />
Ah! little kenn'd thy reverend grannie,<br />
That sark she coft for her wee Nannie,<br />
Wi' twa pund Scots ('twas a' her riches),<br />
Wad ever graced a dance o' witches!<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg&nbsp;628]</a></span>

But here my Muse her wing maun core,<br />
Sic flights are far beyond her power;<br />
To sing how Nannie lap and flang<br />
(A souple jade she was, and strang),<br />
And how Tam stood, like ane bewitch'd,<br />
And thought, his very een enriched.<br />
Even Satan glower'd, and fidged fu' fain,<br />
And hotch'd and blew wi' might and main;<br />
Till first ae caper, syne anither,<br />
Tam tint his reason a' thegither,<br />
And roars out, "Weel done, Cutty-sark!"<br />
And in an instant a' was dark:<br />
And scarcely had he Maggie rallied,<br />
When out the hellish legion sallied.<br />
As bees bizz out wi' angry fyke,<br />
When plundering herds assail their byke,<br />
As open pussie's mortal foes,<br />
When, pop! she starts before their nose;<br />
As eager runs the market-crowd,<br />
When "Catch the thief!" resounds aloud;<br />
So Maggie runs, the witches follow,<br />
Wi' mony an eldritch screech and hollow.<br />
<br />
Ah, Tam! ah, Tam! thou'lt get thy fairin'!<br />
In hell they'll roast thee like a herrin'!<br />
In vain thy Kate awaits thy comin'!<br />
Kate soon will be a woefu' woman!<br />
Now, do thy speedy utmost, Meg,<br />
And win the keystane of the brig;<br />
There at them thou thy tail may toss,<br />
A running stream they darena cross;<br />
But ere the keystane she could make,<br />
The fient a tail she had to shake!<br />
For Nannie, far before the rest,<br />
Hard upon noble Maggie prest,<br />
And flew at Tam wi' furious ettle;<br />
But little wist she Maggie's mettle&mdash;<br />
Ae spring brought off her master hale,<br />
But left behind her ain grey tail:<br />
The carlin caught her by the rump,<br />
And left poor Maggie scarce a stump.<br />

Now, wha this tale o' truth shall read,<br />
Ilk man and mother's son, take heed:<br />
Whane'er to drink you are inclined,<br />
Or cutty-sarks run in your mind,<br />
Think! ye may buy the joys ower dear&mdash;<br />
Remember Tam o' Shanter's mare.<br />

<h3>THAT GENTLE MAN FROM BOSTON TOWN</h3>

<h4>AN IDYL OF OREGON</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Two webfoot brothers loved a fair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Young lady, rich and good to see;</span><br />
And oh, her black abundant hair!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And oh, her wondrous witchery!</span><br />
Her father kept a cattle farm,<br />
These brothers kept her safe from harm:<br />
<br />
From harm of cattle on the hill;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From thick-necked bulls loud bellowing</span><br />
The livelong morning, loud and shrill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lashing sides like anything;</span><br />
From roaring bulls that tossed the sand<br />
And pawed the lilies from the land.<br />
<br />
There came a third young man. He came<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From far and famous Boston town.</span><br />
He was not handsome, was not "game,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he could "cook a goose" as brown</span><br />
As any man that set foot on<br />
The sunlit shores of Oregon.<br />
<br />
This Boston man he taught the school,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Taught gentleness and love alway,</span><br />
Said love and kindness, as a rule,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would ultimately "make it pay."</span><br />
He was so gentle, kind, that he<br />
Could make a noun and verb agree.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg&nbsp;630]</a></span>

<br />
So when one day the brothers grew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All jealous and did strip to fight,</span><br />
He gently stood between the two,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And meekly told them 'twas not right.</span><br />
"I have a higher, better plan,"<br />
Outspake this gentle Boston man.<br />
<br />
"My plan is this: Forget this fray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">About that lily hand of hers;</span><br />
Go take your guns and hunt all day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">High up yon lofty hill of firs,</span><br />
And while you hunt, my loving doves,<br />
Why, I will learn which one she loves."<br />
<br />
The brothers sat the windy hill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their hair shone yellow, like spun gold,</span><br />
Their rifles crossed their laps, but still<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They sat and sighed and shook with cold.</span><br />
Their hearts lay bleeding far below;<br />
Above them gleamed white peaks of snow.<br />
<br />
Their hounds lay couching, slim and neat;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A spotted circle in the grass.</span><br />
The valley lay beneath their feet;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They heard the wide-winged eagles pass.</span><br />
The eagles cleft the clouds above;<br />
Yet what could they but sigh and love?<br />
<br />
"If I could die," the elder sighed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"My dear young brother here might wed."</span><br />
"Oh, would to Heaven I had died!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The younger sighed, with bended head.</span><br />
Then each looked each full in the face<br />
And each sprang up and stood in place.<br />
<br />
"If I could die,"&mdash;the elder spake,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Die by your hand, the world would say</span><br />
'Twas accident;&mdash;and for her sake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dear brother, be it so, I pray."</span><br />
"Not that!" the younger nobly said;<br />
Then tossed his gun and turned his head.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg&nbsp;631]</a></span>

<br />
And fifty paces back he paced!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as he paced he drew the ball;</span><br />
Then sudden stopped and wheeled and faced<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His brother to the death and fall!</span><br />
Two shots rang wild upon the air!<br />
But lo! the two stood harmless there!<br />
<br />
An eagle poised high in the air;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far, far below the bellowing</span><br />
Of bullocks ceased, and everywhere<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vast silence sat all questioning.</span><br />
The spotted hounds ran circling round<br />
Their red, wet noses to the ground.<br />
<br />
And now each brother came to know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That each had drawn the deadly ball;</span><br />
And for that fair girl far below<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had sought in vain to silent fall.</span><br />
And then the two did gladly "shake,"<br />
And thus the elder bravely spake:<br />
<br />
"Now let us run right hastily<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tell the kind schoolmaster all!</span><br />
Yea! yea! and if she choose not me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But all on you her favors fall,</span><br />
This valiant scene, till all life ends,<br />
Dear brother, binds us best of friends."<br />
<br />
The hounds sped down, a spotted line,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bulls in tall, abundant grass,</span><br />
Shook back their horns from bloom and vine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And trumpeted to see them pass&mdash;</span><br />
They loved so good, they loved so true,<br />
These brothers scarce knew what to do.<br />
<br />
They sought the kind schoolmaster out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As swift as sweeps the light of morn;</span><br />
They could but love, they could not doubt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This man so gentle, "in a horn,"</span><br />
They cried, "Now whose the lily hand&mdash;<br />
That lady's of this webfoot land?"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg&nbsp;632]</a></span>

<br />
They bowed before that big-nosed man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That long-nosed man from Boston town;</span><br />
They talked as only lovers can,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They talked, but he could only frown;</span><br />
And still they talked, and still they plead;<br />
It was as pleading with the dead.<br />
<br />
At last this Boston man did speak&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Her father has a thousand ceows,</span><br />
An hundred bulls, all fat and sleek;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He also had this ample heouse."</span><br />
The brothers' eyes stuck out thereat,<br />
So far you might have hung your hat.<br />
<br />
"I liked the looks of this big heouse&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My lovely boys, won't you come in?</span><br />
Her father has a thousand ceows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He also had a heap of tin.</span><br />
The guirl? Oh yes, the guirl, you see&mdash;<br />
The guirl, just neow she married me."<br />

<h3>THE YARN OF THE "NANCY BELL"</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
'Twas on the shores that round our coast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Deal to Ramsgate span,</span><br />
That I found alone on a piece of stone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An elderly naval man.</span><br />
<br />
His hair was weedy, his beard was long,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And weedy and long was he,</span><br />
And I heard this wight on the shore recite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a singular minor key:</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, I am a cook and the captain bold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the mate of the <i>Nancy</i> brig,</span><br />
And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the crew of the captain's gig."</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg&nbsp;633]</a></span>

<br />
And he shook his fists and he tore his hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till I really felt afraid,</span><br />
For I couldn't help thinking the man had been drinking,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so I simply said:</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, elderly man, it's little I know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the duties of men of the sea,</span><br />
And I'll eat my hand if I understand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How you can possibly be</span><br />
<br />
"At once a cook, and a captain bold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the mate of the <i>Nancy</i> brig,</span><br />
And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the crew of the captain's gig."</span><br />
<br />
Then he gave a hitch to his trousers, which<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is a trick all seamen larn,</span><br />
And having got rid of a thumping quid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He spun this painful yarn:</span><br />
<br />
"'Twas in the good ship <i>Nancy Bell</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That we sailed to the Indian Sea,</span><br />
And there on a reef we come to grief,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which has often occurred to me.</span><br />
<br />
"And pretty nigh all the crew was drowned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(There was seventy-seven o' soul),</span><br />
And only ten of the <i>Nancy's</i> men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said 'here' to the muster-roll.</span><br />
<br />
"There was me and the cook and the captain bold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the mate of the <i>Nancy</i> brig,</span><br />
And the bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the crew of the captain's gig.</span><br />
<br />
"For a month we'd neither wittles nor drink,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till a-hungry we did feel,</span><br />
So we drawed a lot, and accordin' shot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The captain for our meal.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg&nbsp;634]</a></span>

<br />
"The next lot fell to the <i>Nancy's</i> mate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a delicate dish he made;</span><br />
Then our appetite with the midshipmite<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We seven survivors stayed.</span><br />
<br />
"And then we murdered the bos'un tight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he much resembled pig;</span><br />
Then we wittled free, did the cook and me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the crew of the captain's gig.</span><br />
<br />
"Then only the cook and me was left,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the delicate question, 'Which</span><br />
Of us two goes to the kettle?' arose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we argued it out as sich.</span><br />
<br />
"For I loved that cook as a brother, I did,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the cook he worshipped me;</span><br />
But we'd both be blowed if we'd either be stowed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the other chap's hold, you see.</span><br />
<br />
"'I'll be eat if you dines off me,' says Tom.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Yes, that,' says I, 'you'll be,&mdash;</span><br />
I'm boiled if I die, my friend,' quoth I.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And 'Exactly so,' quoth he.</span><br />
<br />
"Says he, 'Dear James, to murder me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were a foolish thing to do,</span><br />
For don't you see that you can't cook <i>me</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While I can&mdash;and will&mdash;cook <i>you</i>!'</span><br />
<br />
"So he boils the water, and takes the salt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the pepper in portions true</span><br />
(Which he never forgot), and some chopped shalot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some sage and parsley too.</span><br />
<br />
"'Come here,' says he, with a proper pride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which his smiling features tell,</span><br />
''Twill soothing be if I let you see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How extremely nice you'll smell.'</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg&nbsp;635]</a></span>

<br />
"And he stirred it round and round and round,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he sniffed at the foaming froth;</span><br />
When I ups with his heels, and smothers his squeals<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the scum of the boiling broth.</span><br />
<br />
"And I eat that cook in a week or less,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And&mdash;as I eating be</span><br />
The last of his chops, why, I almost drops,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a vessel in sight I see.</span></p>

<hr style="width: 33%; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;" />

<p>"And I never larf, and I never smile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I never lark or play,</span><br />
But sit and croak, and a single joke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have,&mdash;which is to say:</span><br />

<h3>FERDINANDO AND ELVIRA</h3>

<h4>OR, THE GENTLE PIEMAN</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p class='h_5'>PART I</p>

<p class='poem'>At a pleasant evening party I had taken down to supper</p>
<p class='poem'>One whom I will call Elvira, and we talked of love and Tupper.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>Mr. Tupper and the Poets, very lightly with them dealing,</p>
<p class='poem'>For I've always been distinguished for a strong poetic feeling.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>Then we let off paper crackers, each of which contained a motto,</p>
<p class='poem'>And she listened while I read them, till her mother told her not to.</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg&nbsp;636]</a></span>

</p>
<p class='poem'>Then she whispered, "To the ballroom we had better, dear, be walking;</p>
<p class='poem'>If we stop down here much longer, really people will be talking."</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>There were noblemen in coronets, and military cousins,</p>
<p class='poem'>There were captains by the hundred, there were baronets by dozens.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>Yet she heeded not their offers, but dismissed them with a blessing;</p>
<p class='poem'>Then she let down all her back hair, which had taken long in dressing.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>Then she had convulsive sobbings in her agitated throttle,</p>
<p class='poem'>Then she wiped her pretty eyes and smelt her pretty smelling bottle.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>So I whispered, "Dear Elvira, say,&mdash;what can the matter be with you?</p>
<p class='poem'>Does anything you've eaten, darling Popsy, disagree with you?"</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>But spite of all I said, her sobs grew more and more distressing,</p>
<p class='poem'>And she tore her pretty back hair, which had taken long in dressing.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>Then she gazed upon the carpet, at the ceiling, then above me,</p>
<p class='poem'>And she whispered, "Ferdinando, do you really, <i>really</i> love me?"</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>"Love you?" said I, then I sighed, and then I gazed upon her sweetly&mdash;</p>
<p class='poem'>For I think I do this sort of thing particularly neatly.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>"Send me to the Arctic regions, or illimitable azure,</p>
<p class='poem'>On a scientific goose-chase, with my Coxwell or my Glaisher!</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg&nbsp;637]</a></span>

</p>
<p class='poem'>"Tell me whither I may hie me&mdash;tell me, dear one, that I may know&mdash;</p>
<p class='poem'>Is it up the highest Andes? down a horrible volcano?"</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>But she said, "It isn't polar bears, or hot volcanic grottoes;</p>
<p class='poem'>Only find out who it is that writes those lovely cracker mottoes!"</p>

<p class='h_5'>PART II</p>

<p class='poem'>"Tell me, Henry Wadsworth, Alfred, Poet Close, or Mister Tupper,</p>
<p class='poem'>Do you write the bon-ton mottoes my Elvira pulls at supper?"</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>But Henry Wadsworth smiled, and said he had not had that honor;</p>
<p class='poem'>And Alfred, too, disclaimed the words that told so much upon her.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>"Mister Martin Tupper, Poet Close, I beg of you inform us;"</p>
<p class='poem'>But my question seemed to throw them both into a rage enormous.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>Mister Close expressed a wish that he could only get anigh to me;</p>
<p class='poem'>And Mister Martin Tupper sent the following reply to me:</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>"A fool is bent upon a twig, but wise men dread a bandit,"&mdash;</p>
<p class='poem'>Which I know was very clever; but I didn't understand it.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>Seven weary years I wandered&mdash;Patagonia, China, Norway,</p>
<p class='poem'>Till at last I sank exhausted at a pastrycook his doorway.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>There were fuchsias and geraniums, and daffodils and myrtle;</p>
<p class='poem'>So I entered, and I ordered half a basin of mock turtle.</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg&nbsp;638]</a></span>

</p>
<p class='poem'>He was plump and he was chubby, he was smooth and he was rosy,</p>

<h3>GENTLE ALICE BROWN</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
It was a robber's daughter, and her name was Alice Brown.<br />
Her father was the terror of a small Italian town;<br />
Her mother was a foolish, weak, but amiable old thing;<br />
But it isn't of her parents that I'm going for to sing.<br />
<br />
As Alice was a-sitting at her window-sill one day,<br />
A beautiful young gentleman he chanced to pass that way;<br />
She cast her eyes upon him, and he looked so good and true,<br />
That she thought, "I could be happy with a gentleman like you!"<br />
<br />
And every morning passed her house that cream of gentlemen,<br />
She knew she might expect him at a quarter unto ten,<br />
A sorter in the Custom-house, it was his daily road<br />
(The Custom-house was fifteen minutes' walk from her abode.)<br />
<br />
But Alice was a pious girl, who knew it wasn't wise<br />
To look at strange young sorters with expressive purpleeyes;<br />
So she sought the village priest to whom her family confessed,<br />
The priest by whom their little sins were carefully assessed.<br />
<br />
"Oh, holy father," Alice said, "'twould grieve you, would it not?<br />
To discover that I was a most disreputable lot!<br />
Of all unhappy sinners I'm the most unhappy one!"<br />
The padre said, "Whatever have you been and gone and done?"<br />
<br />
"I have helped mamma to steal a little kiddy from its dad,<br />
I've assisted dear papa in cutting up a little lad.<br />
I've planned a little burglary and forged a little cheque,<br />
And slain a little baby for the coral on its neck!"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg&nbsp;640]</a></span>
<br />
The worthy pastor heaved a sigh, and dropped a silent tear&mdash;<br />
And said, "You mustn't judge yourself too heavily, my dear&mdash;<br />
It's wrong to murder babies, little corals for to fleece;<br />
But sins like these one expiates at half-a-crown apiece.<br />
<br />
"Girls will be girls&mdash;you're very young, and flighty in your mind;<br />
Old heads upon young shoulders we must not expect to find:<br />
We mustn't be too hard upon these little girlish tricks&mdash;<br />
Let's see&mdash;five crimes at half-a-crown&mdash;exactly twelve-and-six."<br />
<br />
"Oh, father," little Alice cried, "your kindness makes me weep,<br />
You do these little things for me so singularly cheap&mdash;<br />
Your thoughtful liberality I never can forget;<br />
But oh, there is another crime I haven't mentioned yet!<br />
<br />
"A pleasant-looking gentleman, with pretty purple eyes,<br />
I've noticed at my window, as I've sat a-catching flies;<br />
He passes by it every day as certain as can be&mdash;<br />
I blush to say I've winked at him and he has winked at me!"<br />
<br />
"For shame," said Father Paul, "my erring daughter! On my word<br />
This is the most distressing news that I have ever heard.<br />
Why, naughty girl, your excellent papa has pledged your hand<br />
To a promising young robber, the lieutenant of his band!<br />
<br />
"This dreadful piece of news will pain your worthy parents so!<br />
They are the most remunerative customers I know;<br />
For many many years they've kept starvation from my doors,<br />
I never knew so criminal a family as yours!<br />
<br />
"The common country folk in this insipid neighborhood<br />
Have nothing to confess, they're so ridiculously good;<br />
And if you marry any one respectable at all,<br />
Why, you'll reform, and what will then become of Father Paul?"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg&nbsp;641]</a></span>
<br />
The worthy priest, he up and drew his cowl upon his crown,<br />
And started off in haste to tell the news to Robber Brown;<br />
To tell him how his daughter, who was now for marriage fit,<br />
Had winked upon a sorter, who reciprocated it.<br />
<br />
Good Robber Brown, he muffled up his anger pretty well,<br />
He said, "I have a notion, and that notion I will tell;<br />
I will nab this gay young sorter, terrify him into fits,<br />
And get my gentle wife to chop him into little bits.<br />
<br />
"I've studied human nature, and I know a thing or two,<br />
Though a girl may fondly love a living gent, as many do&mdash;<br />
A feeling of disgust upon her senses there will fall<br />
When she looks upon his body chopped particularly small."<br />
<br />
He traced that gallant sorter to a still suburban square;<br />
He watched his opportunity and seized him unaware;<br />
He took a life-preserver and he hit him on the head,<br />
And Mrs. Brown dissected him before she went to bed.<br />
<br />
And pretty little Alice grew more settled in her mind,<br />
She nevermore was guilty of a weakness of the kind,<br />
Until at length good Robber Brown bestowed her pretty hand<br />
On the promising young robber, the lieutenant of his band.<br />

<h3>THE STORY OF PRINCE AGIB</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Strike the concertina's melancholy string!<br />
Blow the spirit-stirring harp like anything!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Let the piano's martial blast</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Rouse the Echoes of the Past,</span><br />
For of Agib, Prince of Tartary, I sing!<br />
<br />
Of Agib, who, amid Tartaric scenes,<br />
Wrote a lot of ballet music in his teens:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His gentle spirit rolls</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In the melody of souls&mdash;</span><br />
Which is pretty, but I don't know what it means.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg&nbsp;642]</a></span>
<br />
Of Agib, who could readily, at sight,<br />
Strum a march upon the loud Theodolite.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He would diligently play</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">On the Zoetrope all day,</span><br />
And blow the gay Pantechnicon all night.<br />
<br />
One winter&mdash;I am shaky in my dates&mdash;<br />
Came two starving Tartar minstrels to his gates;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Oh, Allah be obeyed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">How infernally they played!</span><br />
I remember that they called themselves the "O&uuml;aits."<br />
<br />
Oh! that day of sorrow, misery, and rage<br />
I shall carry to the Catacombs of Age,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Photographically lined</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">On the tablet of my mind,</span><br />
When a yesterday has faded from its page!<br />
<br />
Alas! Prince Agib went and asked them in;<br />
Gave them beer, and eggs, and sweets, and scent, and tin.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And when (as snobs would say)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">They had "put it all away,"</span><br />
He requested them to tune up and begin.<br />
<br />
Though its icy horror chill you to the core,<br />
I will tell you what I never told before,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The consequences true</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of that awful interview,</span><br />
<i>For I listened at the keyhole in the door!</i><br />
<br />
They played him a sonata&mdash;let me see!<br />
"<i>Medulla oblongata</i>"&mdash;key of G.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Then they began to sing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That extremely lovely thing,</span><br />
"<i>Scherzando! ma non troppo, ppp.</i>"<br />
<br />
He gave them money, more than they could count,<br />
Scent from a most ingenious little fount,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">More beer, in little kegs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Many dozen hard-boiled eggs,</span><br />
And goodies to a fabulous amount.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg&nbsp;643]</a></span>
<br />
Now follows the dim horror of my tale<br />
And I feel I'm growing gradually pale,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For, even at this day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Though its sting has passed away,</span><br />
When I venture to remember it, I quail!<br />
<br />
The elder of the brothers gave a squeal,<br />
All-overish it made me for to feel;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Oh, Prince," he says, says he,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"<i>If a Prince indeed you be</i>,</span><br />
I've a mystery I'm going to reveal!<br />
<br />
"Oh, listen, if you'd shun a horrid death,<br />
To what the gent who's speaking to you saith:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">No 'O&uuml;aits' in truth are we,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">As you fancy that we be;</span><br />
For (ter-remble!) I am Aleck&mdash;this is Beth!"<br />
<br />
Said Agib, "Oh! accursed of your kind,<br />
I have heard that ye are men of evil mind!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Beth gave a fearful shriek&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But before he'd time to speak</span><br />
I was mercilessly collared from behind.<br />
<br />
In number ten or twelve, or even more,<br />
They fastened me full length upon the floor.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">On my face extended flat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I was walloped with a cat</span><br />
For listening at the keyhole of a door.<br />
<br />
Oh! the horror of that agonizing thrill!<br />
(I can feel the place in frosty weather still).<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For a week from ten to four</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I was fastened to the floor,</span><br />
While a mercenary wopped me with a will.<br />
<br />
They branded me and broke me on a wheel,<br />
And they left me in an hospital to heal;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And, upon my solemn word,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I have never never heard</span><br />
What those Tartars had determined to reveal.<br />

Sir Guy was a doughty crusader,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A muscular knight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ever ready to fight,</span><br />
A very determined invader,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Dickey de Lion's delight.</span><br />
<br />
Lenore was a Saracen maiden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Brunette, statuesque,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The reverse of grotesque;</span><br />
Her pa was a bagman from Aden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her mother she played in burlesque.</span><br />
<br />
A <i>coryph&eacute;e</i>, pretty and loyal,<br />

Her mother performed at the Royal,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lenore at the Saracen's Head.</span><br />
<br />
Of face and of figure majestic,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She dazzled the cits&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ecstaticised pits;&mdash;</span><br />
Her troubles were only domestic,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But drove her half out of her wits.</span><br />
<br />
Her father incessantly lashed her,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She was grudgingly fed;</span><br />
Whenever her father he thrashed her,<br />

He purchased a stall for the season<br />

<br />
His views were exceedingly proper,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He wanted to wed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So he called at her shed</span><br />
And saw her progenitor whop her&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her mother sit down on her head.</span><br />

"So pretty," said he, "and so trusting!<br />

It was Euchre. The same<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He did not understand;</span><br />
But he smiled as he sat by the table,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a smile that was childlike and bland.</span><br />
<br />
Yet the cards they were stocked<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a way that I grieve,</span><br />
And my feelings were shocked<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the state of Nye's sleeve:</span><br />
Which was stuffed full of aces and bowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the same with intent to deceive.</span><br />
<br />
But the hands that were played<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By that heathen Chinee,</span><br />
And the points that he made,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were quite frightful to see&mdash;</span><br />
Till at last he put down a right bower,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which the same Nye had dealt unto me.</span><br />
<br />
Then I looked up at Nye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he gazed upon me;</span><br />
And he rose with a sigh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And said, "Can this be?</span><br />
We are ruined by Chinese cheap labour&mdash;"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he went for that heathen Chinee.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg&nbsp;650]</a></span>
<br />
In the scene that ensued<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I did not take a hand;</span><br />
But the floor it was strewed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the leaves on the strand</span><br />
With the cards that Ah Sin had been hiding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the game "he did not understand."</span><br />
<br />
In his sleeves, which were long,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He had twenty-four packs&mdash;</span><br />
Which was coming it strong,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet I state but the facts;</span><br />
And we found on his nails, which were taper,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What is frequent in tapers&mdash;that's wax.</span><br />
<br />
Which is why I remark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And my language is plain,</span><br />
That for ways that are dark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And for tricks that are vain,</span><br />
The heathen Chinee is peculiar&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which the same I am free to maintain.</span><br />

<h3>THE SOCIETY UPON THE STANISLAUS</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
I reside at Table Mountain, and my name is Truthful James;<br />
I am not up to small deceit, or any sinful games;<br />
And I'll tell in simple language what I know about the row<br />
That broke up our society upon the Stanislow.<br />
<br />
But first I would remark, that it is not a proper plan<br />
For any scientific man to whale his fellow-man,<br />
And, if a member don't agree with his peculiar whim,<br />
To lay for that same member for to "put a head" on him.<br />
<br />
Now, nothing could be finer or more beautiful to see<br />
Than the first six months' proceedings of that same society,<br />
Till Brown of Calaveras brought a lot of fossil bones<br />
That he found within a tunnel near the tenement of Jones.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg&nbsp;651]</a></span>
<br />
Then Brown he read a paper, and he reconstructed there,<br />
From those same bones, an animal that was extremely rare;<br />
And Jones then asked the Chair for a suspension of the rules,<br />
Till he could prove that those same bones was one of his lost mules.<br />
<br />
Then Brown he smiled a bitter smile and said he was at fault,<br />
It seemed he had been trespassing on Jones's family vault;<br />
He was a most sarcastic man, this quiet Mr. Brown,<br />
And on several occasions he had cleaned out the town.<br />
<br />
Now, I hold it is not decent for a scientific gent<br />
To say another is an ass&mdash;at least, to all intent;<br />
Nor should the individual who happens to be meant<br />
Reply by heaving rocks at him to any great extent.<br />
<br />
Then Abner Dean of Angel's raised a point of order, when<br />
A chunk of old red sandstone took him in the abdomen,<br />
And he smiled a kind of sickly smile, and curled up on the floor,<br />
And the subsequent proceedings interested him no more.<br />
<br />
For, in less time than I write it, every member did engage<br />
In a warfare with the remnants of a pal&aelig;ozoic age;<br />
And the way they heaved those fossils in their anger was a sin,<br />
Till the skull of an old mammoth caved the head of Thompson in.<br />
<br />
And this is all I have to say of these improper games<br />
For I live at Table Mountain, and my name is Truthful James;<br />
And I've told, in simple language, what I know about the row<br />
That broke up our society upon the Stanislow.<br />

<h3>WILLIAM BROWN OF OREGON</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
They called him Bill, the hired man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But she, her name was Mary Jane,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Squire's daughter; and to reign</span><br />
The belle from Ber-she-be to Dan<br />
Her little game. How lovers rash<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Got mittens at the spelling school!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How many a mute, inglorious fool</span><br />
Wrote rhymes and sighed and died&mdash;mustache!<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg&nbsp;654]</a></span>

<br />
This hired man had loved her long,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had loved her best and first and last,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her very garments as she passed</span><br />
For him had symphony and song.<br />
So when one day with sudden frown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She called him "Bill," he raised his head,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He caught her eye and, faltering, said,</span><br />
"I love you; and my name is Brown."<br />
<br />
She fairly waltzed with rage; she wept;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You would have thought the house on fire.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She told her sire, the portly squire,</span><br />
Then smelt her smelling-salts, and slept.<br />
Poor William did what could be done;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He swung a pistol on each hip,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He gathered up a great ox-whip,</span><br />
And drove toward the setting sun.<br />
<br />
He crossed the great back-bone of earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He saw the snowy mountains rolled</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like mighty billows; saw the gold</span><br />
Of awful sunsets; felt the birth<br />
Of sudden dawn that burst the night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like resurrection; saw the face</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of God and named it boundless space</span><br />
Ringed round with room and shoreless light.<br />
<br />
Her lovers passed. Wolves hunt in packs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They sought for bigger game; somehow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They seemed to see above her brow</span><br />
The forky sign of turkey tracks.<br />
The teter-board of life goes up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The teter-board of life goes down,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sweetest face must learn to frown;</span><br />
The biggest dog has been a pup.<br />
<br />
O maidens! pluck not at the air;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sweetest flowers I have found</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grow rather close unto the ground,</span><br />
And highest places are most bare.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg&nbsp;655]</a></span>

Why, you had better win the grace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of our poor cussed Af-ri-can,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than win the eyes of every man</span><br />
In love alone with his own face.<br />
<br />
At last she nursed her true desire.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She sighed, she wept for William Brown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She watched the splendid sun go down</span><br />
Like some great sailing ship on fire,<br />
Then rose and checked her trunk right on;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in the cars she lunched and lunched,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And had her ticket punched and punched,</span><br />
Until she came to Oregon.<br />
<br />
She reached the limit of the lines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She wore blue specs upon her nose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wore rather short and manly clothes,</span><br />
And so set out to reach the mines.<br />
Her pocket held a parasol<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her right hand held a Testament,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus equipped right on she went,</span><br />
Went water-proof and water-fall.<br />
<br />
She saw a miner gazing down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Slow stirring something with a spoon;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O, tell me true and tell me soon,</span><br />
What has become of William Brown?"<br />
He looked askance beneath her specs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then stirred his cocktail round and round.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then raised his head and sighed profound,</span><br />
And said, "He's handed in his checks."<br />
<br />
Then care fed on her damaged cheek,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she grew faint, did Mary Jane,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And smelt her smelling-salts in vain,</span><br />
She wandered, weary, worn, and weak.<br />
At last, upon a hill alone.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She came, and there she sat her down;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For on that hill there stood a stone,</span><br />
And, lo! that stone read, "William Brown."<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg&nbsp;656]</a></span>

<br />
"O William Brown! O William Brown!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And here you rest at last," she said,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"With this lone stone above your head,</span><br />
And forty miles from any town!<br />
I will plant cypress trees, I will,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I will build a fence around,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I will fertilise the ground</span><br />
With tears enough to turn a mill."<br />
<br />
She went and got a hired man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She brought him forty miles from town,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in the tall grass squatted down</span><br />
And bade him build as she should plan.<br />
But cruel cow-boys with their bands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They saw, and hurriedly they ran</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And told a bearded cattle man</span><br />
Somebody builded on his lands.<br />
<br />
He took his rifle from the rack,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He girt himself in battle pelt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He stuck two pistols in his belt,</span><br />
And, mounting on his horse's back,<br />
He plunged ahead. But when they showed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A woman fair, about his eyes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He pulled his hat, and he likewise</span><br />
Pulled at his beard, and chewed and chewed.<br />
<br />
At last he gat him down and spake:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O lady dear, what do you here?"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I build a tomb unto my dear,</span><br />
I plant sweet flowers for his sake."<br />
The bearded man threw his two hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above his head, then brought them down</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cried, "Oh, I am William Brown,</span><br />
And this the corner-stone of my lands!"<br />

<h3>LITTLE BREECHES</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
I don't go much on religion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I never ain't had no show;</span><br />
But I've got a middlin' tight grip, sir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a handful o' things I know.</span><br />
I don't pan out on the prophets<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And free-will and that sort of thing&mdash;</span><br />
But I be'lieve in God and the angels,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ever sence one night last spring.</span><br />
<br />
I come into town with some turnips,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And my little Gabe come along&mdash;</span><br />
No four-year-old in the county<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could beat him for pretty and strong&mdash;</span><br />
Peart and chipper and sassy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Always ready to swear and fight&mdash;</span><br />
And I'd larnt him to chaw terbacker<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Jest to keep his milk-teeth white.</span><br />
<br />
The snow come down like a blanket<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As I passed by Taggart's store;</span><br />
I went in for a jug of molasses<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And left the team at the door.</span><br />
They scared at something and started&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I heard one little squall,</span><br />
And hell-to-split over the prairie!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went team, Little Breeches, and all.</span><br />
<br />
Hell-to-split over the prairie!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I was almost froze with skeer;</span><br />
But we rousted up some torches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sarched for 'em far and near.</span><br />
At last we struck hosses and wagon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Snowed under a soft white mound,</span><br />
Upsot, dead beat, but of little Gabe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No hide nor hair was found.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg&nbsp;658]</a></span>

<br />
And hero all hope soured on me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of my fellow-critter's aid;</span><br />
I jest flopped down on my marrow-bones,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crotch-deep in the snow, and prayed.</span></p>

<hr style="width: 33%; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em;" />

<p>By this, the torches was played out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And me and Isrul Parr</span><br />
Went off for some wood to a sheepfold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That he said was somewhar thar.</span><br />
<br />
We found it at last, and a little shed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where they shut up the lambs at night;</span><br />
We looked in and seen them huddled thar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So warm and sleepy and white;</span><br />
And thar sot Little Breeches and chirped,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As peart as ever you see,</span><br />
"I want a chaw of terbacker,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And that's what's the matter of me."</span><br />
<br />
How did he git thar? Angels.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He could never have walked in that storm:</span><br />
They jest scooped down and toted him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To whar it was safe and warm.</span><br />
And I think that saving a little child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fotching him to his own,</span><br />
Is a derned sight better business<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than loafing around the Throne.</span><br />

<h3>THE ENCHANTED SHIRT</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
The King was sick. His cheek was red,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his eye was clear and bright;</span><br />
He ate and drank with a kingly zest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And peacefully snored at night.</span><br />
<br />
But he said he was sick, and a king should know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And doctors came by the score.</span><br />
They did not cure him. He cut off their heads,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sent to the schools for more.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg&nbsp;659]</a></span>

<br />
At last two famous doctors came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And one was as poor as a rat,&mdash;</span><br />
He had passed his life in studious toil,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never found time to grow fat.</span><br />
<br />
The other had never looked in a book;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His patients gave him no trouble:</span><br />
If they recovered, they paid him well;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If they died, their heirs paid double.</span><br />
<br />
Together they looked at the royal tongue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the King on his couch reclined;</span><br />
In succession they thumped his august chest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But no trace of disease could find.</span><br />
<br />
The old sage said, "You're as sound as a nut."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Hang him up," roared the King in a gale&mdash;</span><br />
In a ten-knot gale of royal rage;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The other leech grew a shade pale;</span><br />
<br />
But he pensively rubbed his sagacious nose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus his prescription ran&mdash;</span><br />
<i>The King will be well, if he sleeps one night</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>In the Shirt of a Happy Man</i>.</span></p>

<hr style="width: 33%; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;" />

<p>Wide o'er the realm the couriers rode,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fast their horses ran,</span><br />
And many they saw, and to many they spoke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But they found no Happy Man.</span><br />
<br />
They found poor men who would fain be rich,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rich who thought they were poor;</span><br />
And men who twisted their waist in stays,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And women that shorthose wore.</span><br />
<br />
They saw two men by the roadside sit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And both bemoaned their lot;</span><br />
For one had buried his wife, he said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the other one had not.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg&nbsp;660]</a></span>

<br />
At last they came to a village gate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A beggar lay whistling there;</span><br />
He whistled, and sang, and laughed, and rolled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the grass in the soft June air.</span><br />
<br />
The weary couriers paused and looked<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the scamp so blithe and gay;</span><br />
And one of them said, "Heaven save you, friend!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You seem to be happy to-day."</span><br />
<br />
"O yes, fair sirs," the rascal laughed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his voice rang free and glad;</span><br />
"An idle man has so much to do<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That he never has time to be sad."</span><br />
<br />
"This is our man," the courier said;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Our luck has lead us aright.</span><br />
I will give you a hundred ducats, friend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the loan of your shirt to-night."</span><br />
<br />
The merry blackguard lay back on the grass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And laughed till his face was black;</span><br />
"I would do it, God wot," and he roared with the fun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But I haven't a shirt to my back."</span></p>

<hr style="width: 33%; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;" />

<p>
Each day to the King the reports came in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of his unsuccessful spies,</span><br />
And the sad panorama of human woes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Passed daily under his eyes.</span><br />
<br />
And he grew ashamed of his useless life,<br />

<h3>JIM BLUDSO</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Wal, no! I can't tell whar he lives,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because he don't live, you see;</span><br />
Leastways, he's got out of the habit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of livin' like you and me.</span><br />
Whar have you been for the last three years<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That you haven't heard folks tell</span><br />
How Jemmy Bludso passed-in his checks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The night of the Prairie Belle?</span><br />
<br />
He weren't no saint&mdash;them engineers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is all pretty much alike&mdash;</span><br />
One wife in Natchez-under-the-Hill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And another one here in Pike.</span><br />
A keerless man in his talk was Jim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And an awkward man in a row&mdash;</span><br />
But he never flunked, and he never lied;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I reckon he never knowed how.</span><br />
<br />
And this was all the religion he had&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To treat his engines well;</span><br />
Never be passed on the river;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To mind the pilot's bell;</span><br />
And if ever the Prairie Belle took fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A thousand times he swore,</span><br />
He'd hold her nozzle agin the bank<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the last soul got ashore.</span><br />
<br />
All boats have their day on the Mississip,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her day come at last.</span><br />
The Movastar was a better boat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the Belle she wouldn't be passed;</span><br />
And so come tearin' along that night,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The oldest craft on the line,</span><br />
With a nigger squat on her safety valve,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her furnace crammed, rosin and pine.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg&nbsp;662]</a></span>

<br />
The fire bust out as she clared the bar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And burnt a hole in the night,</span><br />
And quick as a flash she turned, and made<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To that willer-bank on the right.</span><br />
There was runnin' and cursin', but Jim yelled out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over all the infernal roar,</span><br />
"I'll hold her nozzle agin the bank<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the last galoot's ashore."</span><br />
<br />
Through the hot black breath of the burnin' boat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Jim Bludso's voice was heard,</span><br />
And they all had trust in his cussedness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And know he would keep his word.</span><br />
And, sure's you're born, they all got off<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Afore the smokestacks fell,&mdash;</span><br />
And Bludso's ghost went up alone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the smoke of the Prairie Belle.</span><br />
<br />
He weren't no saint&mdash;but at jedgment<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd run my chance with Jim,</span><br />
'Longside of some pious gentlemen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That wouldn't shook hands with him.</span><br />
He'd seen his duty, a dead-sure thing&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And went for it thar and then:</span><br />
And Christ ain't a going to be too hard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a man that died for men.</span><br />

<h3>THE ALARMED SKIPPER</h3>

<h4>"IT WAS AN ANCIENT MARINER"</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Many a long, long year ago,<br />
Nantucket skippers had a plan<br />
Of finding out, though "lying low,"<br />
How near New York their schooners ran.<br />
<br />
They greased the lead before it fell,<br />
And then, by sounding through the night,<br />
Knowing the soil that stuck, so well,<br />
They always guessed their reckoning right.<br />
<br />
A skipper gray, whose eyes were dim,<br />
Could tell, by <i>tasting</i>, just the spot,<br />
And so below he'd "dowse the glim"&mdash;<br />
After, of course, his "something hot."<br />
<br />
Snug in his berth, at eight o'clock,<br />
This ancient skipper might be found;<br />
No matter how his craft would rock,<br />
He slept&mdash;for skippers' naps are sound!<br />
<br />
The watch on deck would now and then<br />
Run down and wake him, with the lead;<br />
He'd up, and taste, and tell the men<br />
How many miles they went ahead.<br />
<br />
One night, 'twas Jotham Marden's watch,<br />
A curious wag&mdash;the peddler's son&mdash;<br />
And so he mused (the wanton wretch),<br />
"To-night I'll have a grain of fun.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[Pg&nbsp;665]</a></span>

<br />
"We're all a set of stupid fools<br />
To think the skipper knows by <i>tasting</i><br />
What ground he's on&mdash;Nantucket schools<br />
Don't teach such stuff, with all their basting!"<br />
<br />
And so he took the well-greased lead<br />
And rubbed it o'er a box of earth<br />
That stood on deck&mdash;a parsnip-bed&mdash;<br />
And then he sought the skipper's berth.<br />
<br />
"Where are we now, sir? Please to taste."<br />
The skipper yawned, put out his tongue,<br />
Then ope'd his eyes in wondrous haste,<br />
And then upon the floor he sprung!<br />
<br />
The skipper stormed and tore his hair,<br />
Thrust on his boots, and roared to Marden,<br />
"<i>Nantucket's sunk, and here we are<br />
Right over old Marm Hackett's garden!</i>"<br />

<h3>SAYING NOT MEANING</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Two gentlemen their appetite had fed,<br />
When opening his toothpick-case, one said,<br />
"It was not until lately that I knew<br />
That <i>anchovies</i> on <i>terr&acirc; firm&acirc;</i> grew."<br />
"Grow!" cried the other, "yes, they <i>grow</i>, indeed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like other fish, but not upon the land;</span><br />
You might as well say grapes grow on a reed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or in the Strand!"</span><br />
<br />
"Why, sir," returned the irritated other,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">"My brother,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When at Calcutta</span><br />
Beheld them <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> growing;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He wouldn't utter</span><br />
A lie for love or money, sir; so in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This matter you are thoroughly mistaken."</span><br />
"Nonsense, sir! nonsense! I can give no credit<br />
To the assertion&mdash;none e'er saw or read it;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your brother, like his evidence, should be shaken."</span><br />
<br />
"Be shaken, sir! let me observe, you are<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Perverse&mdash;in short&mdash;"</span><br />
"Sir," said the other, sucking his cigar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then his port&mdash;</span><br />
"If you will say impossibles are true,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You may affirm just anything you please&mdash;</span><br />
That swans are quadrupeds, and lions blue,<br />

What's propagated merely to deceive."<br />
<br />
"Then you force me to say, sir, you're a fool,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Return'd the bragger.</span><br />
Language like this no man can suffer cool:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It made the listener stagger;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So, thunder-stricken, he at once replied,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The traveler <i>lied</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who had the impudence to tell it you;"</span><br />
"Zounds! then d'ye mean to swear before my face<br />

And take to duelling or thumping <i>t&ecirc;tes</i>;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thinking by strength of artery to atone</span><br />
For strength of argument; and he who winces<br />
From force of words, with force of arms convinces!<br />

With pistols, powder, bullets, surgeons, lint,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When each opines himself, though frighten'd, right,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each is, in courtesy, oblig'd to fight!</span><br />
And they <i>did</i> fight: from six full measured paces<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The unbeliever pulled his trigger first;</span><br />
And fearing, from the braggart's ugly faces,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The whizzing lead had whizz'd its very worst,</span><br />
Ran up, and with a <i>duelistic</i> fear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(His ire evanishing like morning vapors),</span><br />
Found him possess'd of one remaining ear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who in a manner sudden and uncouth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had given, not lent, the other ear to truth;</span><br />
For while the surgeon was applying lint,<br />

<h3>GRAMPY SINGS A SONG</h3>

<p>
Row-diddy, dow de, my little sis,<br />
Hush up your teasin' and listen to this:<br />
'Tain't much of a jingle, 'tain't much of a tune,<br />
But it's spang-fired truth about Chester Cahoon.<br />
The thund'rinest fireman Lord ever made<br />
Was Chester Cahoon of the Tuttsville Brigade.<br />
He was boss of the tub and the foreman of hose;<br />
When the 'larm rung he'd start, sis, a-sheddin' his clothes,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[Pg&nbsp;671]</a></span>

&mdash;Slung cote and slung wes'cote and kicked off his shoes,<br />
A-runnin' like fun, for he'd no time to lose.<br />
And he'd howl down the ro'd in a big cloud of dust,<br />
For he made it his brag he was allus there fust.<br />
&mdash;Allus there fust, with a whoop and a shout,<br />
And he never shut up till the fire was out.<br />
And he'd knock out the winders and save all the doors,<br />
And tear off the clapboards, and rip up the floors,<br />
For he allus allowed 'twas a tarnation sin<br />
To 'low 'em to burn, for you'd want 'em agin.<br />
He gen'rally stirred up the most of his touse<br />
In hustling to save the outside of the house.<br />
And after he'd wrassled and hollered and pried,<br />
He'd let up and tackle the stuff 'twas inside.<br />
To see him you'd think he was daft as a loon,<br />
But that was jest habit with Chester Cahoon.<br />
<br />
Row diddy-iddy, my little sis,<br />
Now see what ye think of a doin' like this:<br />
The time of the fire at Jenkins' old place<br />
It got a big start&mdash;was a desprit case;<br />
The fambly they didn't know which way to turn.<br />
And by gracious, it looked like it all was to burn.<br />
But Chester Cahoon&mdash;oh, that Chester Cahoon,<br />
He sailed to the roof like a reg'lar balloon;<br />
Donno how he done it, but done it he did,<br />
&mdash;Went down through the scuttle and shet down the lid.<br />
And five minutes later that critter he came<br />
To the second floor winder surrounded by flame.<br />
He lugged in his arms, sis, a stove and a bed,<br />
And balanced a bureau right square on his head.<br />
His hands they was loaded with crockery stuff,<br />
China and glass; as if that warn't enough,<br />
He'd rolls of big quilts round his neck like a wreath,<br />
And carried Mis' Jenkins' old aunt with his teeth.<br />
You're right&mdash;gospel right, little sis,&mdash;didn't seem<br />
The critter'd git down, but he called for the stream,<br />
And when it come strong and big round as my wrist;<br />
He stuck out his legs, sis, and give 'em a twist;<br />
And he hooked round the water jes' if 'twas a rope,<br />
And down he come easin' himself on the slope,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg&nbsp;672]</a></span>

&mdash;So almighty spry that he made that 'ere stream<br />
As fit for his pupp'us' as if 'twas a beam.<br />
Oh, the thund'rinest fireman Lord ever made<br />
Was Chester Cahoon of the Tuttsville Brigade.<br />

<h3>THE ROMANCE OF THE CARPET</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Basking in peace in the warm spring sun,<br />
South Hill smiled upon Burlington.<br />
<br />
The breath of May! and the day was fair,<br />
And the bright motes danced in the balmy air.<br />
<br />
And the sunlight gleamed where the restless breeze<br />
Kissed the fragrant blooms on the apple-trees.<br />
<br />
His beardless cheek with a smile was spanned,<br />
As he stood with a carriage whip in his hand.<br />
<br />
And he laughed as he doffed his bobtail coat,<br />
And the echoing folds of the carpet smote.<br />
<br />
And she smiled as she leaned on her busy mop,<br />
And said she'd tell him when to stop.<br />
<br />
So he pounded away till the dinner-bell<br />
Gave him a little breathing spell.<br />
<br />
But he sighed when the kitchen clock struck one,<br />
And she said the carpet wasn't done.<br />
<br />
But he lovingly put in his biggest licks,<br />
And he pounded like mad till the clock struck six.<br />
<br />
And she said, in a dubious sort of way,<br />
That she guessed he could finish it up next day.<br />
<br />
Then all that day, and the next day, too,<br />
That fuzz from the dirtless carpet flew.<br />
<br />
And she'd give it a look at eventide,<br />
And say, "Now beat on the other side."<br />
<br />
And the new days came as the old days went,<br />
And the landlord came for his regular rent.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[Pg&nbsp;675]</a></span>

<br />
And the neighbors laughed at the tireless broom,<br />
And his face was shadowed with clouds of gloom.<br />
<br />
Till at last, one cheerless winter day,<br />
He kicked at the carpet and slid away.<br />
<br />
Over the fence and down the street,<br />
Speeding away with footsteps fleet.<br />
<br />
And never again the morning sun<br />
Smiled on him beating his carpet-drum.<br />
<br />
And South Hill often said with a yawn,<br />
"Where's the carpet-martyr gone?"<br />
<br />
Years twice twenty had come and passed<br />
And the carpet swayed in the autumn blast.<br />
<br />
For never yet, since that bright spring-time,<br />
Had it ever been taken down from the line.<br />
<br />
Over the fence a gray-haired man<br />
Cautiously clim, clome, clem, clum, clamb.<br />
<br />
He found him a stick in the old woodpile,<br />
And he gathered it up with a sad, grim smile,<br />
<br />
A flush passed over his face forlorn<br />
As he gazed at the carpet, tattered and torn.<br />
<br />
And he hit it a most resounding thwack,<br />
Till the startled air gave his echoes back.<br />
<br />
And out of the window a white face leaned,<br />
And a palsied hand the pale face screened.<br />
<br />
She knew his face; she gasped, and sighed,<br />
"A little more on the other side."<br />
<br />
Right down on the ground his stick he throwed,<br />
And he shivered and said, "Well, I am blowed!"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[Pg&nbsp;676]</a></span>

<br />
And he turned away, with a heart full sore,<br />
And he never was seen not more, not more.<br />

<h3>THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
"Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The five unmistakable marks</span><br />
By which you may know, wheresoever you go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The warranted genuine Snarks.</span><br />
<br />
"Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:</span><br />
Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a flavor of Will-o'-the-wisp.</span><br />
<br />
"Its habit of getting up late you'll agree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That it carries too far when I say</span><br />
That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dines on the following day.</span></p>

<hr style="width: 33%; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;" />

<p>"The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which it constantly carries about,</span><br />
And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A sentiment open to doubt.</span><br />
<br />
"The fifth is ambition. It next will be right<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To describe each particular batch;</span><br />
Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From those that have whiskers, and scratch.</span><br />
<br />
"For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet I feel it my duty to say</span><br />
Some are Boojums&mdash;" The Bellman broke off in alarm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the Baker had fainted away.</span><br />
<br />
They roused him with muffins&mdash;they roused him with ice&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They roused him with mustard and cress&mdash;</span><br />
They roused him with jam and judicious advice&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They set him conundrums to guess.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[Pg&nbsp;677]</a></span>

<br />
When at length he sat up and was able to speak,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His sad story he offered to tell;</span><br />
And the Bellman cried "Silence! Not even a shriek!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And excitedly tingled his bell.</span><br />
<br />
There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Scarcely even a howl or a groan,</span><br />
As the man they called "Ho!" told his story of woe.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In an antediluvian tone.</span><br />
<br />
"My father and mother were honest, though poor&mdash;"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Skip all that!" cried the Bellman in haste,</span><br />
"If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We have hardly a minute to waste!"</span><br />
<br />
"I skip forty years," said the Baker, in tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And proceed without further remark</span><br />
To the day when you took me aboard of your ship<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To help you in hunting the Snark.</span><br />
<br />
"A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remarked, when I bade him farewell&mdash;"</span><br />
"Oh, skip your dear uncle," the Bellman exclaimed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he angrily tingled his bell.</span><br />
<br />
"He remarked to me then," said that mildest of men,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right;</span><br />
Fetch it home by all means&mdash;you may serve it with greens<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it's handy for striking a light.</span><br />
<br />
"'You may seek it with thimbles&mdash;and seek it with care;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You may hunt it with forks and hope;</span><br />
You may threaten its life with a railway-share;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You may charm it with smiles and soap&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
"'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If your Snark be a Boojum! For then</span><br />
You will softly and suddenly vanish away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never be met with again!'</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[Pg&nbsp;678]</a></span>

<br />
"It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I think of my uncle's last words:</span><br />
And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brimming over with quivering curds!</span><br />
<br />
"I engage with the Snark&mdash;every night after dark&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a dreamy delirious fight:</span><br />
I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I use it for striking a light:</span><br />
<br />
"But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a moment (of this I am sure),</span><br />
I shall softly and suddenly vanish away&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the notion I cannot endure!"</span><br />

Never heerd him speak but once<br />
Er twice in my life,&mdash;and first time was<br />
When the army broke out, and Jim he went,<br />
The Old man backin' him, fer three months.&mdash;<br />
And all 'at I heerd the Old man say<br />
Was, jes' as we turned to start away,&mdash;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Jes' <i>lookin'</i> at Jim,</span><br />
And likin' him all to hisse'f-like, see?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">'Cause he was jes' wrapped up in him!</span><br />
And over and over I mind the day<br />
The Old man come and stood round in the way<br />
While we was drillin', a-watchin' Jim&mdash;<br />
And down at the deepot a-heerin' him say,&mdash;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Disting'ished Jim;&mdash;</span><br />
Neighbours all ust to wonder why<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The Old man 'peared wrapped up in him:</span><br />
But when Cap. Biggler, he writ back,<br />
'At Jim was the bravest boy we had<br />
In the whole dern rigiment, white er black,<br />
And his fightin' good as his farmin' bad&mdash;<br />
'At he had led, with a bullet clean<br />
Bored through his thigh, and carried the flag<br />
Through the bloodiest battle you ever seen,&mdash;<br />
The Old man wound up a letter to him<br />
'At Cap. read to us, 'at said,&mdash;"Tell Jim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Good-bye;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">And take keer of hisse'f."</span><br />
<br />
Jim come back jes' long enough<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To take the whim</span><br />
'At he'd like to go back in the cavelry&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And the Old man jes' wrapped up in him!&mdash;</span><br />
Jim 'lowed 'at he'd had sich luck afore,<br />
Guessed he'd tackle her three years more.<br />
And the Old man give him a colt he'd raised<br />
And follered him over to Camp Ben Wade,<br />
And laid around fer a week er so,<br />
Watchin' Jim on dress-parade&mdash;<br />
Tel finally he rid away,<br />
And last he heerd was the Old man say,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Well; good-bye, Jim:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Take keer of yourse'f!"</span><br />
<br />
Tuk the papers, the Old man did,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A-watchin' fer Jim&mdash;</span><br />
Fully believin' he'd make his mark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Some</i> way&mdash;jes' wrapped up in him!&mdash;</span><br />
And many a time the word 'u'd come<br />
'At stirred him up like the tap of a drum&mdash;<br />
At Petersburg, fer instance, where<br />
Jim rid right into their cannons there,<br />
And tuk 'em, and p'inted 'em t'other way,<br />
And socked it home to the boys in grey,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Well; good-bye, Jim:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Take keer of yourse'f!"</span><br />
<br />
Think of a private, now, perhaps,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">We'll say like Jim,</span><br />
'At's clumb clean up to the shoulder-straps&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And the Old man jes' wrapped up in him!</span><br />
Think of him&mdash;with the war plum' through,<br />
And the glorious old Red-White-and-Blue<br />
A-laughin' the news down over Jim,<br />
And the Old man, bendin' over him&mdash;<br />
The surgeon turnin' away with tears<br />
'At hadn't leaked fer years and years&mdash;<br />
As the hand of the dyin' boy clung to<br />
His father's, the old voice in his ears,&mdash;<br />

"He took the anchor on his back,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And leaped into the main;</span><br />
Through foam and spray he clove his way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sunk and rose again!</span><br />
<br />
"Through foam and spray, a league away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The anchor stout he bore;</span><br />
Till, safe at last, he made it fast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And warped the ship ashore!</span><br />

And suth'in to do, if I say it, too,<br />

<br />
<i>Such was the tale that was told to me<br />
By that modest and truthful son of the sea,<br />
And I envy the life of a second mate,<br />

As would go and lie to a poor marine.</i><br />

<h3>THE CONVERTED CANNIBALS</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Upon an island, all alone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They lived, in the Pacific;</span><br />
Somewhere within the Torrid Zone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where heat is quite terrific.</span><br />
'Twould shock you were I to declare<br />
The many things they did not wear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Altho' no doubt</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">One's best without</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such things in heat terrific.</span><br />
<br />
Though cannibals by birth were they,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet, since they'd first existed,</span><br />
Their simple menu day by day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of such-like things consisted:</span><br />
Omelets of turtle's eggs, and yams,<br />
And stews from freshly-gathered clams,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Such things as these</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Were,&mdash;if you please,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of what their fare consisted.</span><br />
<br />
But after dinner they'd converse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor did their topic vary;</span><br />
Wild tales of gore they would rehearse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And talk of <i>missionary</i>.</span><br />
They'd gaze upon each other's joints,<br />
And indicate the tender points.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Said one: "For us</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">'Tis dangerous</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To <i>think</i> of <i>missionary</i>."</span><br />
<br />
Well, on a day, upon the shore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As flotsam, or as jetsam,</span><br />
Some wooden cases,&mdash;ten, or more,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were cast up. "Let us get some,</span><br />
And see, my friend, what they contain;<br />
The chance may not occur again,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Said good Who-zoo.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Said Tum-tum, "Do;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We'll both wade out and get some."</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[Pg&nbsp;684]</a></span>

<br />
The cases held,&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">Prime Missionary&mdash;tinned.</span>"</span><br />
Nay! gentle reader, do not shrink&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The man who made it sinned:</span><br />
He thus had labelled bloater-paste<br />
To captivate the native taste.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He hoped, of course,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">This fraud to force</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On them. In this he sinned.</span><br />
<br />
Our simple friends knew naught of sin;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They thought that this confection</span><br />
<i>Was</i> missionary in a tin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">According to direction.</span><br />
For very joy they shed salt tears.<br />
"'Tis what we've waited for, for years,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Said they. "Hooray!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">We'll feast to-day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">According to direction."</span><br />
<br />
"'Tis very tough," said one, for he<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tin and all had eaten.</span><br />
"Too salt," the other said, "for me;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The flavour might be beaten."</span><br />
It was enough. Soon each one swore<br />
He'd missionary eat no more:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Their tastes were cured,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">They felt assured</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This flavour might be beaten.</span><br />
<br />
And, should a missionary call<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To-day, he'd find them gentle,</span><br />
With no perverted tastes at all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And manners ornamental;</span><br />
He'd be received, I'm bound to say,<br />
In courteous and proper way;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Nor need he fear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To taste their cheer</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">However ornamental.</span><br />

<h3>SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Of all the rides since the birth of time,<br />
Told in story or sung in rhyme,&mdash;<br />
On Apuleius's Golden Ass,<br />
Or one-eyed Calendar's horse of brass,<br />
Witch astride of a human back,<br />
Islam's prophet on Al-Borak,&mdash;<br />
The strangest ride that ever was sped<br />
Was Ireson's, out from Marblehead!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By the women of Marblehead!</span><br />
<br />
Body of turkey, head of owl,<br />
Wings a-droop like a rained-on fowl,<br />
Feathered and ruffled in every part,<br />
Skipper Ireson stood in the cart.<br />
Scores of women, old and young,<br />
Strong of muscle, and glib of tongue,<br />
Pushed and pulled up the rocky lane,<br />
Shouting and singing the shrill refrain:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By the women o' Morble'ead!"</span><br />
<br />
Wrinkled scolds with hands on hips,<br />
Girls in bloom of cheek and lips,<br />
Wild-eyed, free-limbed, such as chase<br />
Bacchus round some antique vase,<br />
Brief of skirt, with ankles bare,<br />
Loose of kerchief and loose of hair,<br />
With conch-shells blowing and fish-horns' twang,<br />
Over and over the M&aelig;nads sang:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By the women o' Morble'ead!"</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[Pg&nbsp;689]</a></span>

<br />
Small pity for him!&mdash;He sailed away<br />
From a leaking ship, in Chaleur Bay,&mdash;<br />
Sailed away from a sinking wreck,<br />
With his own town's-people on her deck!<br />
"Lay by! lay by!" they called to him.<br />
Back he answered, "Sink or swim!<br />
Brag of your catch of fish again!"<br />
And off he sailed through the fog and rain!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By the women of Marblehead!</span><br />
<br />
Fathoms deep in dark Chaleur<br />
That wreck shall lie forevermore.<br />
Mother and sister, wife and maid,<br />
Looked from the rocks of Marblehead<br />
Over the moaning and rainy sea,&mdash;<br />
Looked for the coming that might not be!<br />
What did the winds and the sea-birds say<br />
Of the cruel captain who sailed away?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By the women of Marblehead!</span><br />
<br />
Through the street, on either side,<br />
Up flew windows, doors swung wide;<br />
Sharp-tongued spinsters, old wives gray,<br />
Treble lent the fish-horn's bray.<br />
Sea-worn grandsires, cripple-bound,<br />
Hulks of old sailors run aground,<br />
Shook head, and fist, and hat, and cane,<br />
And cracked with curses the hoarse refrain:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By the women o' Morble'ead!"</span><br />
<br />
Sweetly along the Salem road<br />
Bloom of orchard and lilac showed.<br />
Little the wicked skipper knew<br />
Of the fields so green and the sky so blue.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[Pg&nbsp;690]</a></span>

Riding there in his sorry trim,<br />
Like an Indian idol glum and grim,<br />
Scarcely he seemed the sound to hear<br />
Of voices shouting, far and near:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By the women o' Morble'ead!"</span><br />
<br />
"Hear me, neighbors!" at last he cried,&mdash;<br />
"What to me is this noisy ride?<br />
What is the shame that clothes the skin<br />
To the nameless horror that lives within?<br />
Waking or sleeping, I see a wreck,<br />
And hear a cry from a reeling deck!<br />
Hate me and curse me,&mdash;I only dread<br />
The hand of God and the face of the dead!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By the women of Marblehead!</span><br />
<br />
Then the wife of the skipper lost at sea<br />
Said, "God has touched him! Why should we?"<br />
Said an old wife, mourning her only son:<br />
"Cut the rogue's tether and let him run!"<br />
So with soft relentings and rude excuse,<br />
Half scorn, half pity, they cut him loose,<br />
And gave him a cloak to hide him in,<br />
And left him alone with his shame and sin.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart</span><br />

<h3>DARIUS GREEN AND HIS FLYING-MACHINE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
If ever there lived a Yankee lad,<br />
Wise or otherwise, good or bad,<br />
Who, seeing the birds fly, didn't jump<br />
With flapping arms from stake or stump,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Or, spreading the tail</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Of his coat for a sail,</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[Pg&nbsp;691]</a></span>

Take a soaring leap from post or rail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And wonder why</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">He couldn't fly,</span><br />
And flap and flutter and wish and try&mdash;<br />
If ever you knew a country dunce<br />
Who didn't try that as often as once,<br />
All I can say is, that's a sign<br />
He never would do for a hero of mine.<br />
<br />
An aspiring genius was D. Green:<br />
The son of a farmer, age fourteen;<br />
His body was long and lank and lean&mdash;<br />
Just right for flying, as will be seen;<br />
He had two eyes as bright as a bean,<br />
And a freckled nose that grew between,<br />
A little awry&mdash;for I must mention<br />
That he had riveted his attention<br />
Upon his wonderful invention,<br />
Twisting his tongue as he twisted the strings,<br />
And working his face as he worked the wings,<br />
And with every turn of gimlet and screw<br />
Turning and screwing his mouth round too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Till his nose seemed bent</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">To catch the scent,</span><br />
Around some corner, of new-baked pies,<br />
And his wrinkled cheeks and his squinting eyes<br />
Grew puckered into a queer grimace,<br />
That made him look very droll in the face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And also very wise.</span><br />
And wise he must have been, to do more<br />
Than ever a genius did before,<br />
Excepting D&aelig;dalus of yore<br />
And his son Icarus, who wore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Upon their backs</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Those wings of wax</span><br />
He had read of in the old almanacs.<br />
Darius was clearly of the opinion<br />
That the air is also man's dominion,<br />
And that, with paddle or fin or pinion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">We soon or late shall navigate</span><br />
The azure as now we sail the sea.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[Pg&nbsp;692]</a></span>

<br />
The thing looks simple enough to me;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And if you doubt it,</span><br />
Hear how Darius reasoned about it.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"The birds can fly an' why can't I?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Must we give in," says he with a grin.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"That the bluebird an' ph&oelig;be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Are smarter'n we be?</span><br />
Jest fold our hands an' see the swaller<br />
An' blackbird an' catbird beat us holler?<br />
Doos the little chatterin', sassy wren,<br />
No bigger'n my thumb, know more than men?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Just show me that!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Ur prove 't the bat</span><br />
Hez got more brains than's in my hat.<br />
An' I'll back down, an' not till then!"<br />
He argued further: "Nur I can't see<br />
What's th' use o' wings to a bumble-bee,<br />
Fur to git a livin' with, more'n to me;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Ain't my business</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Important's his'n is?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">That Icarus</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Made a perty muss&mdash;</span><br />
Him an' his daddy D&aelig;dalus<br />
They might 'a' knowed wings made o' wax<br />
Wouldn't stand sun-heat an' hard whacks.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">I'll make mine o' luther,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Ur suthin' ur other."</span><br />
<br />
And he said to himself, as he tinkered and planned:<br />
"But I ain't goin' to show my hand<br />
To mummies that never can understand<br />
The fust idee that's big an' grand."<br />
So he kept his secret from all the rest,<br />
Safely buttoned within his vest;<br />
And in the loft above the shed<br />
Himself he locks, with thimble and thread<br />
And wax and hammer and buckles and screws<br />
And all such things as geniuses use;&mdash;<br />
Two bats for patterns, curious fellows!<br />
A charcoal-pot and a pair of bellows;<br />
Some wire, and several old umbrellas;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[Pg&nbsp;693]</a></span>

A carriage-cover, for tail and wings;<br />
A piece of harness; and straps and strings;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And a big strong box,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">In which he locks</span><br />
These and a hundred other things.<br />
His grinning brothers, Reuben and Burke<br />
And Nathan and Jotham and Solomon, lurk<br />
Around the corner to see him work&mdash;<br />
Sitting cross-legged, like a Turk,<br />
Drawing the waxed-end through with a jerk,<br />
And boring the holes with a comical quirk<br />
Of his wise old head, and a knowing smirk.<br />
But vainly they mounted each other's backs,<br />
And poked through knot-holes and pried through cracks;<br />
With wood from the pile and straw from the stacks<br />
He plugged the knot-holes and caulked the cracks;<br />
And a dipper of water, which one would think<br />
He had brought up into the loft to drink<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">When he chanced to be dry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Stood always nigh,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">For Darius was sly!</span><br />
And whenever at work he happened to spy<br />
At chink or crevice a blinking eye,<br />
He let the dipper of water fly.<br />
"Take that! an' ef ever ye git a peep,<br />
Guess ye'll ketch a weasel asleep!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And he sings as he locks</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">His big strong box:&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
"The weasel's head is small an' trim,<br />
An' he is little an' long an' slim,<br />
An' quick of motion an' nimble of limb<br />
An' ef you'll be<br />
Advised by me,<br />
Keep wide awake when ye're ketchin' him!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">So day after day</span><br />
He stitched and tinkered and hammered away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Till at last 'twas done&mdash;</span><br />
The greatest invention under the sun!<br />
"An' now," says Darius, "hooray fur some fun!"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[Pg&nbsp;694]</a></span>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">'Twas the Fourth of July,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And the weather was dry,</span><br />
And not a cloud was on all the sky,<br />
Save a few light fleeces, which here and there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Half mist, half air,</span><br />
Like foam on the ocean went floating by&mdash;<br />
Just as lovely a morning as ever was seen<br />
For a nice little trip in a flying-machine.<br />
Thought cunning Darius: "Now I shan't go<br />
Along 'ith the fellers to see the show.<br />
I'll say I've got sich a terrible cough!<br />
An' then, when the folks 'ave all gone off,<br />
I'll hev full swing fur to try the thing,<br />
An' practise a little on the wing."<br />
"Ain't goin' to see the celebration?"<br />
Says brother Nate. "No; botheration!<br />
I've got sich a cold&mdash;a toothache&mdash;I&mdash;<br />
My gracious!&mdash;feel's though I should fly!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Said Jotham, "Sho!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Guess ye better go."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">But Darius said, "No!</span><br />
Shouldn't wonder 'f you might see me, though,<br />
'Long 'bout noon, ef I git red<br />
O' this jumpin', thumpin' pain 'n my head."<br />
For all the while to himself he said:&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"I tell ye what!</span><br />
I'll fly a few times around the lot,<br />
To see how 't seems, then soon's I've got<br />
The hang o' the thing, ez likely's not,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">I'll astonish the nation,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">An' all creation,</span><br />
By flyin' over the celebration!<br />
Over their heads I'll sail like an eagle;<br />
I'll balance myself on my wings like a sea-gull:<br />
I'll dance on the chimbleys; I'll stand on the steeple;<br />
I'll flop up to winders an' scare the people!<br />
I'll light on the liberty-pole, an' crow;<br />
An' I'll say to the gawpin' fools below,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">'What world's this 'ere</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">That I've come near?'</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[Pg&nbsp;695]</a></span>

Fur I'll make 'em b'lieve I'm a chap f'm the moon;<br />
An' I'll try to race 'ith their ol' balloon!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">He crept from his bed;</span><br />
And, seeing the others were gone, he said,<br />
"I'm gittin' over the cold 'n my head."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And away he sped,</span><br />
To open the wonderful box in the shed.<br />
<br />
His brothers had walked but a little way,<br />
When Jotham to Nathan chanced to say,<br />
"What is the feller up to, hey!"<br />
"Don'o'&mdash;the 's suthin' ur other to pay,<br />
Ur he wouldn't 'a' stayed tu hum to-day."<br />
Says Burke, "His toothache's all 'n his eye!<br />
<i>He</i> never 'd missed a Fo'th-o'-July,<br />
Ef he hedn't got some machine to try."<br />
Then Sol, the little one, spoke: "By darn!<br />
Le's hurry back an' hide 'n the barn,<br />
An' pay him fur tellin' us that yarn!"<br />
"Agreed!" Through the orchard they creep back<br />
Along by the fences, behind the stack,<br />
And one by one, through a hole in the wall,<br />
In under the dusty barn they crawl,<br />
Dressed in their Sunday garments all;<br />
And a very astonishing sight was that,<br />
When each in his cobwebbed coat and hat<br />
Came up through the floor like an ancient rat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And there they hid;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And Reuben slid</span><br />
The fastenings back, and the door undid.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"Keep dark!" said he,</span><br />
"While I squint an' see what the' is to see."<br />
<br />
As knights of old put on their mail&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">From head to foot an iron suit,</span><br />
Iron jacket and iron boot,<br />
Iron breeches, and on the head<br />
No hat, but an iron pot instead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And under the chin the bail,</span><br />
(I believe they called the thing a helm,)<br />
Then sallied forth to overwhelm<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[Pg&nbsp;696]</a></span>

The dragons and pagans that plagued the earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">So this <i>modern</i> knight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Prepared for flight,</span><br />
Put on his wings and strapped them tight<br />
Jointed and jaunty, strong and light&mdash;<br />
Buckled them fast to shoulder and hip;<br />
Ten feet they measured from tip to tip<br />
And a helm had he, but that he wore,<br />
Not on his head, like those of yore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">But more like the helm of a ship.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"Hush!" Reuben said,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"He's up in the shed!</span><br />
He's opened the winder&mdash;I see his head!<br />
He stretches it out, an' pokes it about,<br />
Lookin' to see 'f the coast is clear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">An' nobody near;&mdash;</span><br />
Guess he don' o' who's hid in here!<br />
He's riggin' a spring-board over the sill!<br />
Stop laffin', Solomon! Burke, keep still!<br />
He's a climbin' out now&mdash;Of all the things!<br />
What's he got on? I vum, it's wings!<br />
An' that 'tother thing? I vum, it's a tail!<br />
An' there he sits like a hawk on a rail!<br />
Steppin' careful, he travels the length<br />
Of his spring-board, and teeters to try its strength.<br />
Now he stretches his wings, like a monstrous bat;<br />
Peeks over his shoulder; this way an' that,<br />
Fur to see 'f the' 's any one passin' by;<br />
But the' 's on'y a caf an' goslin nigh.<br />
<i>They</i> turn up at him a wonderin' eye,<br />
To see&mdash; The dragon! he's goin' to fly!<br />
Away he goes! Jimminy! what a jump!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Flop&mdash;flop&mdash;an' plump</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">To the ground with a thump!</span><br />
Flutt'rin' an' flound'rin' all 'n a lump!"<br />
<br />
As a demon is hurled by an angel's spear,<br />
Heels over head, to his proper sphere&mdash;<br />
Heels over head, and head over heels,<br />
Dizzily down the abyss he wheels&mdash;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[Pg&nbsp;697]</a></span>

<br />
So fell Darius. Upon his crown,<br />
In the midst of the barn-yard, he came down,<br />
In a wonderful whirl of tangled strings,<br />
Broken braces and broken springs.<br />
Broken tail and broken wings,<br />
Shooting-stars, and various things;<br />
Barn-yard litter of straw and chaff,<br />
And much that wasn't so sweet by half.<br />
Away with a bellow fled the calf,<br />
And what was that? Did the gosling laugh?<br />
'Tis a merry roar from the old barn-door,<br />
And he hears the voice of Jotham crying,<br />
"Say, D'rius! how do you like flyin'?"<br />
Slowly, ruefully, where he lay,<br />
Darius just turned and looked that way,<br />
As he stanched his sorrowful nose with his cuff.<br />
"Wal, I like flyin' well enough,"<br />
He said; "but the' ain't such a thunderin' sight<br />
O' fun in 't when ye come to light."<br />
<br />
I just have room for the <span class="smcap">moral</span> here:<br />
And this is the moral&mdash;Stick to your sphere.<br />
Or if you insist, as you have the right,<br />
On spreading your wings for a loftier flight,<br />
The moral is&mdash;Take care how you light.<br />

"He sorter kinder shut one eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And spit into his hand,</span><br />
And put his ugly head one side,<br />

<br />
"'My boy,' says he, 'it's my belief,<br />

"He thundered on the stranger's mug,<br />

<h3>THE DONNYBROOK JIG</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Oh! 'twas Dermot O'Nolan M'Figg,<br />
That could properly handle a twig,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He wint to the fair, and kicked up a dust there,</span><br />
In dancing a Donnybrook jig&mdash;with his twig.<br />
Oh! my blessing to Dermot M'Figg.<br />
<br />
Whin he came to the midst of the fair,<br />
He was all in a paugh for fresh air,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the fair very soon, was as full&mdash;as the moon,</span><br />
Such mobs upon mobs as were there, oh rare!<br />
So more luck to sweet Donnybrook Fair.<br />
<br />
But Dermot, his mind on love bent,<br />
In search of his sweetheart he went,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peep'd in here and there, as he walked through the fair,</span><br />
And took a small drop in each tent&mdash;as he went,&mdash;<br />
Oh! on whisky and love he was bent.<br />
<br />
And who should he spy in a jig,<br />
With a meal-man so tall and so big,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But his own darling Kate, so gay and so nate?</span><br />
Faith! her partner he hit him a dig&mdash;the pig,<br />
He beat the meal out of his wig.<br />
<br />
The piper, to keep him in tune,<br />
Struck up a gay lilt very soon;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until an arch wag cut a hole in the bag,</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[Pg&nbsp;701]</a></span>

And at once put an end to the tune&mdash;too soon&mdash;<br />
Och! the music flew up to the moon.<br />
<br />
The meal-man he looked very shy,<br />
While a great big tear stood in his eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He cried, "Lord, how I'm kilt, all alone for that jilt;</span><br />
With her may the devil fly high in the sky,<br />
For I'm murdered, and don't know for why."<br />
<br />
"Oh!" says Dermot, and he in the dance,<br />
Whilst a step to'ards his foe did advance,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"By the Father of Men, say but that word again,</span><br />
And I'll soon knock you back in a trance&mdash;to your dance,<br />
For with me you'd have but small chance."<br />
<br />
"But," says Kitty, the darlint, says she,<br />
"If you'll only just listen to me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It's myself that will show that he can't be your foe,</span><br />
Though he fought for his cousin&mdash;that's me," says she,<br />
"For sure Billy's related to me.<br />
<br />
"For my own cousin-jarmin, Anne Wild,<br />
Stood for Biddy Mulroony's first child;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Biddy's step-son, sure he married Bess Dunn,</span><br />
Who was gossip to Jenny, as mild a child<br />
As ever at mother's breast smiled.<br />
<br />
"And may be you don't know Jane Brown,<br />
Who served goat's-whey in Dundrum's sweet town?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas her uncle's half-brother, who married my mother,</span><br />
And bought me this new yellow gown, to go down<br />
When the marriage was held in Milltown."<br />
<br />
"By the powers, then," says Dermot, "'tis plain,<br />
Like the son of that rapscallion Cain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My best friend I have kilt, though no blood is spilt,</span><br />
But the devil a harm did I mane&mdash;that's plain;<br />
And by me he'll be ne'er kilt again."<br />

<h3>UNFORTUNATE MISS BAILEY</h3>

A captain bold from Halifax who dwelt in country quarters,<br />
Betrayed a maid who hanged herself one morning in her Garters.<br />

One night betimes he went to bed, for he had caught a Fever;<br />
Says he, "I am a handsome man, but I'm a gay Deceiver."<br />
His candle just at twelve o'clock began to burn quite palely,<br />
A Ghost stepped up to his bedside and said "Behold Miss Bailey!"<br />
<br />
"Avaunt, Miss Bailey!" then he cries, "your Face looks white and mealy."<br />
"Dear Captain Smith," the ghost replied, "you've used me ungenteelly;<br />
The Crowner's 'Quest goes hard with me because I've acted frailly,<br />
And Parson Biggs won't bury me though I am dead Miss Bailey."<br />

"Dear Corpse!" said he, "since you and I accounts must once for all close,<br />
There really is a one pound note in my regimental Smallclothes;<br />
I'll bribe the sexton for your grave." The ghost then vanished gaily<br />
Crying "Bless you, Wicked Captain Smith, Remember poor Miss Bailey."<br />

<h3>THE LAIRD O' COCKPEN</h3>
<p class='center'>The last two stanzas were added by Miss Ferrier.</p>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>

<p>
The Laird o' Cockpen, he's proud and he's great;<br />
His mind is ta'en up wi' the things o' the state;<br />
He wanted a wife his braw house to keep;<br />
But favour wi' wooin' was fashious to seek.<br />
<br />
Doun by the dyke-side a lady did dwell,<br />
At his table-head he thought she'd look well<br />
M'Clish's ae daughter o' Claverse-ha' Lee&mdash;<br />
A pennyless lass wi' a lang pedigree.<br />
<br />
His wig was well-pouther'd, as guid as when new,<br />
His waistcoat was white, his coat it was blue:<br />
He put on a ring, a sword, and cock'd hat&mdash;<br />
And wha could refuse the Laird wi' a' that?<br />
<br />
He took the grey mare, and rade cannilie&mdash;<br />
And rapped at the yett o' Claverse-ha' Lee;<br />
"Gae tell mistress Jean to come speedily ben:<br />
She's wanted to speak wi' the Laird o' Cockpen."<br />
<br />
Mistress Jean she was makin' the elder-flower wine;<br />
"And what brings the Laird at sic a like time?"<br />
She put off her apron, and on her silk gown,<br />
Her mutch wi' red ribbons, and gaed awa' down.<br />
<br />
And when she cam' ben, he boued fu' low;<br />
And what was his errand he soon let her know,<br />
Amazed was the Laird when the lady said, Na,<br />
And wi' a laigh curtsie she turned awa'.<br />
<br />
Dumfounder'd he was, but nae sigh did he gi'e;<br />
He mounted his mare, and rade cannilie;<br />
And aften he thought, as he gaed through the glen,<br />
"She's daft to refuse the Laird o' Cockpen."<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[Pg&nbsp;704]</a></span>

<br />
And now that the Laird his exit had made,<br />
Mistress Jean she reflected on what she had said;<br />
"Oh! for ane I'll get better, it's waur I'll get ten&mdash;<br />
I was daft to refuse the Laird o' Cockpen."<br />
<br />
Neist time that the Laird and the Lady were seen,<br />
They were gaun arm and arm to the kirk on the green;<br />
Now she sits in the ha' like a weel-tappit hen,<br />
But as yet there's nae chickens appeared at Cockpen.<br />

<h3>A WEDDING</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
I tell thee, Dick, where I have been;<br />
Where I the rarest things have seen;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, things without compare!</span><br />
Such sights again can not be found<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In any place on English ground,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be it at wake or fair.</span><br />
<br />
At Charing Cross, hard by the way<br />
Where we (thou know'st) do sell our hay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is a house with stairs;</span><br />
And there did I see coming down<br />
Such folks as are not in our town;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vorty at least, in pairs.</span><br />
<br />
Amongst the rest one pest'lent fine<br />
(His beard no bigger tho' than thine)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Walk'd on before the rest;</span><br />
Our landlord looks like nothing to him;<br />
The King (God bless him!) 'twould undo him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should he go still so drest.</span><br />
<br />
At Course-a-park, without all doubt,<br />
He should have first been taken out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By all the maids i' th' town:</span><br />
Though lusty Roger there had been,<br />
Or little George upon the green,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or Vincent of the crown.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[Pg&nbsp;705]</a></span>

<br />
But wot you what? The youth was going<br />
To make an end of all his woing;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The parson for him staid:</span><br />
Yet by his leave, for all his haste,<br />
He did not so much wish all past,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Perchance as did the maid.</span><br />
<br />
The maid (and thereby hangs a tale)<br />
For such a maid no Whitson-ale<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could ever yet produce;</span><br />
No grape that's kindly ripe, could be<br />
So round, so plump, so soft, as she<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor half so full of juyce.</span><br />
<br />
Her finger was so small, the ring<br />
Would not stay on which they did bring;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was too wide a peck:</span><br />
And, to say truth (for out it must),<br />
It look'd like the great collar (just)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">About our young colt's neck.</span><br />
<br />
Her feet beneath her petticoat,<br />
Like little mice, stole in and out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if they fear'd the light:</span><br />
But oh! she dances such a way;<br />
No sun upon an Easter day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is half so fine a sight.</span><br />
<br />
Her cheeks so rare a white was on,<br />
No daisie makes comparison<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Who sees them is undone);</span><br />
For streaks of red were mingled there,<br />
Such as are on a Cath'rine pear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The side that's next the Sun.</span><br />
<br />
Her lips were red; and one was thin,<br />
Compared to that was next her chin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Some bee had stung it newly);</span><br />
But, Dick, her eyes so guard her face,<br />
I durst no more upon them gaze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than on a Sun in July.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[Pg&nbsp;706]</a></span>

<br />
Her mouth so small, when she does speak,<br />
Thou'dst swear her teeth her words did break,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That they might passage get;</span><br />
But she so handled still the matter,<br />
They came as good as ours, or better,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And are not spent a whit.</span><br />
<br />
Passion, oh me! how I run on!<br />
There's that that would be thought upon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I trow, besides the bride.</span><br />
The business of the kitchen's great;<br />
For it is fit that men should eat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor was it there denied.</span><br />
<br />
Just in the nick the Cook knock'd thrice,<br />
And all the waiters in a trice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His summons did obey;</span><br />
Each serving man, with dish in hand,<br />
March'd boldly up like our train'd band,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Presented, and away.</span><br />
<br />
When all the meat was on the table,<br />
What man of knife, or teeth, was able<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To stay to be entreated?</span><br />
And this the very reason was,<br />
Before the parson could say grace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The company was seated.</span><br />
<br />
Now hats fly off, and youths carouse;<br />
Healths first go round, and then the house,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bride's came thick and thick;</span><br />
And when 'twas named another's health,<br />
Perhaps he made it hers by stealth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And who could help it, Dick?)</span><br />
<br />
O' th' sudden, up they rise and dance;<br />
Then sit again, and sigh, and glance:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then dance again, and kiss:</span><br />
Thus sev'ral ways the time did pass,<br />
Till ev'ry woman wish'd her place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ev'ry man wish'd his.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[Pg&nbsp;707]</a></span>

<br />
By this time all were stol'n aside<br />
To counsel and undress the bride;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But that he must not know:</span><br />
But yet 'twas thought he guest her mind,<br />
And did not mean to stay behind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above an hour or so.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon Kotal,</span><br />
On sad Kotal whose people ululate<br />
For their loved Moolla late.<br />
Put away his little turban,<br />
And his narghileh embrowned,<br />
The lord of Kotal&mdash;rural urban&mdash;<br />
'S gone unto his last Akhoond,<br />
'S gone to meet his rival Swattan,<br />

His rival, but in what?<br />
Wherein did the deceased Akhoond of Swat<br />
Kotal's lamented Moolla late,<br />
As it were, emulate?<br />
Was it in the tented field<br />
With crash of sword on shield,<br />
While backward meaner champions reeled<br />
And loud the tom-tom pealed?<br />
Did they barter gash for scar<br />
With the Persian scimetar<br />
Or the Afghanistee tulwar,<br />
While loud the tom-tom pealed&mdash;<br />
While loud the tom-tom pealed,<br />
And the jim-jam squealed,<br />
And champions less well heeled<br />
Their war-horses wheeled<br />
And fled the presence of these mortal big bugs o' the field?<br />
Was Kotal's proud citadel&mdash;<br />
Bastioned, walled, and demi-luned,<br />
Beaten down with shot and shell<br />
By the guns of the Akhoond?<br />
Or were wails despairing caught, as<br />
The burghers pale of Swat<br />
Cried in panic, "Moolla ad Portas?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;Or what?</span><br />
Or made each in the cabinet his mark<br />
Kotalese Gortschakoff, Swattish Bismarck?<br />
Did they explain and render hazier<br />

Did they with speeches from the throne,<br />

<h3>THE BALLAD OF BOUILLABAISSE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
A street there is in Paris famous,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For which no rhyme our language yields,</span><br />
Rue Neuve des Petits Champs its name is&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The New Street of the Little Fields.</span><br />
And here's an inn, not rich and splendid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But still in comfortable case;</span><br />
The which in youth I oft attended,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To eat a bowl of Bouillabaisse.</span><br />
<br />
This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A sort of soup, or broth, or brew,</span><br />
Or hotchpotch of all sorts of fishes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Greenwich never could outdo:</span><br />
Green herbs, red peppers, mussels, saffron,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soles, onions, garlic, roach, and dace:</span><br />
All these you eat at Terr&eacute;'s tavern<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that one dish of Bouillabaisse.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[Pg&nbsp;715]</a></span>

<br />
Indeed, a rich and savoury stew 'tis;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And true philosophers, methinks,</span><br />
Who love all sorts of natural beauties,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should love good victuals and good drinks.</span><br />
And Cordelier or Benedictine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Might gladly, sure, his lot embrace,</span><br />
Nor find a fast-day too afflicting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which served him up a Bouillabaisse.</span><br />
<br />
I wonder if the house still there is?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yes, here the lamp is, as before;</span><br />
The smiling red-cheeked <i>&eacute;caill&egrave;re</i> is<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still opening oysters at the door.</span><br />
Is Terr&eacute; still alive and able?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I recollect his droll grimace:</span><br />
He'd come and smile before your table,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hope you liked your Bouillabaisse.</span><br />
<br />
We enter&mdash;nothing's changed or older.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"How's Monsieur Terr&eacute;, waiter, pray?"</span><br />
The waiter stares, and shrugs his shoulder&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Monsieur is dead this many a day."</span><br />
"It is the lot of saint and sinner,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So honest Terr&eacute;'s run his race."</span><br />
"What will Monsieur require for dinner?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Say, do you still cook Bouillabaisse?"</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, oui, Monsieur," 's the waiter's answer;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Quel vin Monsieur d&eacute;sire-t-il?"</span><br />
"Tell me a good one."&mdash;"That I can, Sir:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Chambertin with yellow seal."</span><br />
"So Terr&eacute;'s gone," I say, and sink in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My old accustom'd corner-place;</span><br />
"He's done with feasting and with drinking,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With Burgundy and with Bouillabaisse."</span><br />
<br />
My old accustom'd corner here is,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The table still is in the nook;</span><br />
Ah! vanished many a busy year is<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This well-known chair since last I took.</span><br />

<br />
Where are you, old companions trusty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of early days here met to dine?</span><br />
Come, waiter! quick, a flagon crusty&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll pledge them in the good old wine.</span><br />
The kind old voices and old faces<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My memory can quick retrace;</span><br />
Around the board they take their places,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And share the wine and Bouillabaisse.</span><br />

There's brave Augustus drives his carriage;<br />

Since here we set the claret flowing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drank, and ate the Bouillabaisse.</span><br />
<br />
Ah me! how quick the days are flitting!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I mind me of a time that's gone,</span><br />
When here I'd sit, as now I'm sitting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In this same place&mdash;but not alone.</span><br />
A fair young form was nestled near me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dear dear face looked fondly up,</span><br />
And sweetly spoke and smiled to cheer me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;There's no one now to share my cup.</span></p>

Fill up the lonely glass, and drain it<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In memory of dear old times.</span><br />
Welcome the wine, whate'er the seal is;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sit you down and say your grace</span><br />
With thankful heart, whate'er the meal is.<br />

<h3>THE BALD-HEADED TYRANT</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
O the quietest home in earth had I,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No thought of trouble, no hint of care;</span><br />
Like a dream of pleasure the days fled by,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Peace had folded her pinions there.</span><br />
But one day there joined in our household band<br />
A bald-headed tyrant from No-man's-land.<br />
<br />
Oh, the despot came in the dead of night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And no one ventured to ask him why;</span><br />
Like slaves we trembled before his might,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our hearts stood still when we heard him cry;</span><br />
For never a soul could his power withstand,<br />
That bald-headed tyrant from No-man's-land.<br />
<br />
He ordered us here, and he sent us there&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though never a word could his small lips speak&mdash;</span><br />
With his toothless gums and his vacant stare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his helpless limbs so frail and weak,</span><br />
Till I cried, in a voice of stern command,<br />
"Go up, thou bald-head from No-man's-land!"<br />
<br />
But his abject slaves they turned on me;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the bears in Scripture, they'd rend me there,</span><br />
The while they worshiped with bended knee<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This ruthless wretch with the missing hair;</span><br />
For he rules them all with relentless hand,<br />
This bald-headed tyrant from No-man's-land.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">[Pg&nbsp;721]</a></span>

<br />
Then I searched for help in every clime,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For peace had fled from my dwelling now,</span><br />
Till I finally thought of old Father Time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And low before him I made my bow.</span><br />
"Wilt thou deliver me out of his hand,<br />
This bald-headed tyrant from No-man's-land?"<br />
<br />
Old Time he looked with a puzzled stare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a smile came over his features grim.</span><br />
"I'll take the tyrant under my care:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Watch what my hour-glass does to him.</span><br />
The veriest humbug that ever was planned<br />
Is this same bald-head from No-man's-land."<br />
<br />
Old Time is doing his work full well&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Much less of might does the tyrant wield;</span><br />
But, ah! with sorrow my heart will swell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sad tears fall as I see him yield.</span><br />
Could I stay the touch of that shriveled hand,<br />
I would keep the bald-head from No-man's-land.<br />
<br />
For the loss of peace I have ceased to care;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like other vassals, I've learned, forsooth,</span><br />
To love the wretch who forgot his hair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hurried along without a tooth,</span><br />
And he rules me too with his tiny hand,<br />
This bald-headed tyrant from No-man's-land.<br />

Barney McGee, there's no end of good luck in you,<br />
Will-o'-the-wisp, with a flicker of Puck in you,<br />
Wild as a bull-pup, and all of his pluck in you&mdash;<br />
Let a man tread on your coat and he'll see!<br />
Eyes like the lakes of Killarney for clarity,<br />
Nose that turns up without any vulgarity,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[Pg&nbsp;722]</a></span>

Smile like a cherub, and hair that is carroty&mdash;<br />
Whoop, you're a rarity, Barney McGee!<br />
Mellow as Tarragon,<br />
Prouder than Aragon&mdash;<br />
Hardly a paragon,<br />
You will agree&mdash;<br />
Here's all that's fine to you!<br />
Books and old wine to you!<br />
Girls be divine to you,<br />
Barney McGee!<br />
<br />
Lucky the day when I met you unwittingly,<br />
Dining where vagabonds came and went flittingly.<br />
Here's some <i>Barbera</i> to drink it befittingly,<br />
That day at Silvio's, Barney McGee!<br />
Many's the time we have quaffed our Chianti there,<br />
Listened to Silvio quoting us Dante there&mdash;<br />
Once more to drink Nebiolo Spumante there,<br />
How we'd pitch Pommery into the sea!<br />
There where the gang of us<br />
Met ere Rome rang of us,<br />
They had the hang of us<br />
To a degree.<br />
How they would trust to you!<br />
That was but just to you.<br />
Here's o'er their dust to you,<br />
Barney McGee!<br />
<br />
Barney McGee, when you're sober you scintillate,<br />
But when you're in drink you're the pride of the intellect;<br />
Divil a one of us ever came in till late,<br />
Once at the bar where you happened to be&mdash;<br />
Every eye there like a spoke in you centering,<br />
You with your eloquence, blarney, and bantering&mdash;<br />
All Vagabondia shouts at your entering,<br />
King of the Tenderloin, Barney McGee!<br />
There's no satiety<br />
In your society<br />
With the variety<br />
Of your <i>esprit</i>.<br />

Here's a long purse to you,<br />
And a great thirst to you!<br />
Fate be no worse to you,<br />
Barney McGee!<br />
<br />
Och, and the girls whose poor hearts you deracinate,<br />
Whirl and bewilder and flutter and fascinate!<br />
Faith, it's so killing you are, you assassinate&mdash;<br />
Murder's the word for you, Barney McGee!<br />
Bold when they're sunny, and smooth when they're showery&mdash;<br />
Oh, but the style of you, fluent and flowery!<br />
Chesterfield's way, with a touch of the Bowery!<br />
How, would they silence you, Barney machree?<br />
Naught can your gab allay,<br />
Learned as Rabelais<br />
(You in his abbey lay<br />
Once on the spree).<br />
Here's to the smile of you,<br />
(Oh, but the guile of you!)<br />
And a long while of you,<br />
Barney McGee!<br />
<br />
Facile with phrases of length and Latinity,<br />
Like honorificabilitudinity,<br />
Where is the maid could resist your vicinity,<br />
Wiled by the impudent grace of your plea?<br />
Then your vivacity and pertinacity<br />
Carry the day with the divil's audacity;<br />
No mere veracity robs your sagacity<br />
Of perspicacity, Barney McGee.<br />
When all is new to them,<br />
What will you do to them?<br />
Will you be true to them?<br />
Who shall decree?<br />
Here's a fair strife to you!<br />
Health and long life to you!<br />
And a great wife to you, Barney McGee!<br />
<br />
Barney McGee, you're the pick of gentility;<br />
Nothing can phase you, you've such a facility;<br />
Nobody ever yet found your utility&mdash;<br />

There is the charm of you, Barney McGee;<br />
Under conditions that others would stammer in,<br />
Still unperturbed as a cat or a Cameron,<br />
Polished as somebody in the Decameron,<br />
Putting the glamour on price or Pawnee.<br />
In your meanderin',<br />
Love and philanderin',<br />
Calm as a mandarin<br />
Sipping his tea!<br />
Under the art of you,<br />
Parcel and part of you,<br />
Here's to the heart of you,<br />
Barney McGee!<br />
<br />
You who were ever alert to befriend a man,<br />
You who were ever the first to defend a man,<br />
You who had always the money to lend a man,<br />
Down on his luck and hard up for a V!<br />
Sure, you'll be playing a harp in beatitude<br />
(And a quare sight you will be in that attitude)&mdash;<br />
Some day, where gratitude seems but a platitude,<br />
You'll find your latitude, Barney McGee.<br />
That's no flim-flam at all,<br />
Frivol or sham at all,<br />
Just the plain&mdash;Damn it all,<br />
Have one with me!<br />
Here's one and more to you!<br />
Friends by the score to you,<br />
True to the core to you,<br />

<h3>A FAREWELL TO TOBACCO</h3>

<p>
May the Babylonish curse<br />
Straight confound my stammering verse,<br />
If I can a passage see<br />
In this word-perplexity,<br />
Or a fit expression find,<br />
Or a language to my mind,<br />
(Still the phrase is wide or scant)<br />
To take leave of thee, <i>great plant</i>!<br />
<br />
Or in any terms relate<br />
Half my love, or half my hate:<br />
For I hate, yet love thee so,<br />
That, whichever thing I show,<br />
The plain truth will seem to be<br />
A contrain'd hyperbole,<br />
And the passion to proceed<br />
More from a mistress than a weed.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sooty retainer to the vine,</span><br />
Bacchus' black servant, negro fine;<br />
Sorcerer, that mak'st us dote upon<br />
Thy begrimed complexion,<br />
And, for thy pernicious sake,<br />
More and greater oaths to break<br />
Than reclaim&egrave;d lovers take<br />
'Gainst women: thou thy siege dost lay<br />
Much too in the female way,<br />
While thou suck'st the laboring breath<br />
Faster than kisses or than death.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou in such a cloud dost bind us</span><br />
That our worst foes cannot find us,<br />
And ill-fortune, that would thwart us,<br />
Shoots at rovers, shooting at us;<br />
While each man, through thy height'ning steam,<br />
Does like a smoking Etna seem,<br />
And all about us does express<br />
(Fancy and wit in richest dress)<br />
A Sicilian fruitfulness.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[Pg&nbsp;727]</a></span>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou through such a mist dost show us</span><br />
That our best friends do not know us,<br />
And, for those allow&egrave;d features,<br />
Due to reasonable creatures,<br />
Liken'st us to fell Chimeras,<br />
Monsters,&mdash;that who see us, fear us;<br />
Worse than Cerberus or Geryon,<br />
Or, who first loved a cloud, Ixion.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bacchus we know, and we allow</span><br />
His tipsy rites. But what art thou<br />
That but by reflex canst show<br />
What his deity can do,<br />
As the false Egyptian spell<br />
Aped the true Hebrew miracle?<br />
Some few vapors thou may'st raise,<br />
The weak brain may serve to amaze,<br />
But to the reins and nobler heart<br />
Canst nor life nor heat impart.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brother of Bacchus, later born,</span><br />

These, as stale, we disallow,<br />
Or judge of <i>thee</i> meant: only thou<br />
His true Indian conquest art;<br />
And, for ivy round his dart,<br />
The reform&egrave;d god now weaves<br />
A finer thyrsus of thy leaves.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Scent to match thy rich perfume</span><br />
Chemic art did ne'er presume<br />
Through her quaint alembic strain,<br />

Plant divine, of rarest virtue;<br />
Blisters on the tongue would hurt you!<br />
'Twas but in a sort I blamed thee;<br />
None e'er prosper'd who defamed thee;<br />
Irony all, and feign'd abuse,<br />
Such as perplex'd lovers use,<br />
At a need, when, in despair<br />
To paint forth their fairest fair,<br />
Or in part but to express<br />
That exceeding comeliness<br />
Which their fancies doth so strike,<br />
They borrow language of dislike;<br />
And, instead of Dearest Miss,<br />
Jewel, Honey, Sweetheart, Bliss,<br />
And those forms of old admiring,<br />
Call her Cockatrice and Siren,<br />
Basilisk, and all that's evil,<br />
Witch, Hyena, Mermaid, Devil,<br />
Ethiop, Wench, and Blackamoor,<br />
Monkey, Ape, and twenty more;<br />
Friendly Trait'ress, loving Foe&mdash;<br />
Not that she is truly so,<br />

Guiltless of the sad divorce.<br />

But, as she who once hath been<br />
A king's consort is a queen<br />
Ever after, nor will bate<br />
Any tittle of her state<br />
Though a widow, or divorced,<br />
So I, from thy converse forced,<br />
The old name and style retain,<br />
A right Katherine of Spain;<br />
And a seat, too, 'mongst the joys<br />
Of the blest Tobacco Boys;<br />
Where, though I, by sour physician,<br />
Am debarr'd the full fruition<br />

<h3>JOHN BARLEYCORN</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
There were three kings into the east,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Three kings both great and high;</span><br />
And they hae sworn a solemn oath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">John Barleycorn should die.</span><br />
<br />
They took a plough and plough'd him down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Put clods upon his head;</span><br />
And they hae sworn a solemn oath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">John Barleycorn was dead.</span><br />
<br />
But the cheerful spring came kindly on,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And showers began to fall:</span><br />
John Barleycorn got up again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sore surprised them all.</span><br />
<br />
The sultry suns of summer came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he grew thick and strong;</span><br />
His head weel arm'd wi' pointed spears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That no one should him wrong.</span><br />
<br />
The sober autumn enter'd mild,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he grew wan and pale;</span><br />
His bending joints and drooping head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Show'd he began to fail.</span><br />
<br />
His colour sicken'd more and more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He faded into age;</span><br />
And then his enemies began<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To show their deadly rage.</span><br />
<br />
They've ta'en a weapon, long and sharp,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cut him by the knee;</span><br />
Then tied him fast upon a cart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a rogue for forgerie.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[Pg&nbsp;731]</a></span>

<br />
They laid him down upon his back,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cudgell'd him full sore;</span><br />
They hung him up before the storm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And turn'd him o'er and o'er.</span><br />
<br />
They fill&egrave;d up a darksome pit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With water to the brim:</span><br />
They heav&egrave;d in John Barleycorn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There let him sink or swim.</span><br />
<br />
They laid him out upon the floor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To work him further woe:</span><br />
And still, as signs of life appear'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They toss'd him to and fro.</span><br />
<br />
They wasted o'er a scorching flame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The marrow of his bones;</span><br />
But a miller used him worst of all&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He crush'd him 'tween two stones.</span><br />
<br />
And they hae ta'en his very heart's blood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drank it round and round,</span><br />
And still the more and more they drank,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their joy did more abound.</span><br />
<br />
John Barleycorn was a hero bold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of noble enterprise;</span><br />
For if you do but taste his blood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twill make your courage rise.</span><br />
<br />
'Twill make a man forget his woe;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twill heighten all his joy:</span><br />
'Twill make the widow's heart to sing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though the tear were in her eye.</span><br />
<br />
Then let us toast John Barleycorn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each man a glass in hand;</span><br />
And may his great posterity<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ne'er fail in old Scotland!</span><br />

The goddess of the epigastrium.<br />

When cold, he warmed them as he would his kin&mdash;<br />
They came as strangers, and he took them in.<br />
<br />
And generous!&mdash;oh, wasn't he? I have known him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Exhibit a celestial amiability:&mdash;</span><br />
He'd eat an enemy, and then would own him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of flavor excellent, despite hostility.</span><br />
The crudest captain of the Turkish navy<br />
He buried in an honorable grave&mdash;y.<br />

And when he dined, the nymphs were always present&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sometimes beside him and sometimes&mdash;before him.</span><br />
When he was tired of one, he called her "sweet,"<br />
And told her she was "good enough to eat."<br />
<br />
He was a man of taste&mdash;and justice, too;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He opened his mouth for e'en the humblest sinner,</span><br />
And three weeks stall-fed an emaciate Jew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before they brought him to the royal dinner.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bread of life dispense&mdash;</span><br />
Well "posted" in theology,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And post and rail his fence.</span><br />
<br />
'Gainst all the vices of the age<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He manfully did battle;</span><br />
His chickens were a biped breed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And quadruped his cattle.</span><br />
<br />
No clock more punctually went,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He ne'er delayed a minute&mdash;</span><br />
Nor ever empty was his purse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he had money in it.</span><br />
<br />
His piety was ne'er denied;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His truths hit saint and sinner;</span><br />
At morn he always breakfasted;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He always dined at dinner.</span><br />
<br />
He ne'er by any luck was grieved,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By any care perplexed&mdash;</span><br />
No filcher he, though when he preached,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He always "took" a text.</span><br />

<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">A nasty, ugly Irishman,</span></p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">A wild, tremendous Irishman,</span></p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'><span style="margin-left: 3em;">His face was no ways beautiful,</span></p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 4em;">For with small-pox 'twas scarr'd across;</span></p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 3em;">And the shoulders of the ugly dog</span></p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Were almost double a yard across.</span></p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">Oh, the lump of an Irishman,</span></p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">The whiskey-devouring Irishman,</span></p>

<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Were more than two feet about, my dear.</span></p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">Oh, the great big Irishman,</span></p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">The rattling, battling Irishman&mdash;</span></p>
<p class='poem'>The stamping, ramping, swaggering, staggering, leathering swash of an Irishman!</p>

<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Being Timothy Thady Mulligan;</span></p>

<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">The boosing, bruising Irishman,</span></p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">The 'toxicated Irishman&mdash;</span></p>
<p class='poem'>The whiskey, frisky, rummy, gummy, brandy, no dandy Irishman!</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quoth Echo, very promptly,&mdash;"Leave her!"</span><br />
<br />
But if some maiden with a heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On me should venture to bestow it,</span><br />
Pray, should I act the wiser part<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To take the treasure or forego it?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quoth Echo, with decision,&mdash;"Go it!"</span><br />
<br />
But what if, seemingly afraid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To bind her fate in Hymen's fetter,</span><br />
She vow she means to die a maid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In answer to my loving letter?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quoth Echo, rather coolly,&mdash;"Let her!"</span><br />
<br />
What if, in spite of her disdain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I find my heart intwined about</span><br />
With Cupid's dear delicious chain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So closely that I can't get out?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quoth Echo, laughingly,&mdash;"Get out!"</span><br />
<br />
But if some maid with beauty blest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As pure and fair as Heaven can make her,</span><br />
Will share my labor and my rest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till envious Death shall overtake her?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quoth Echo (sotto voce),&mdash;"Take her!"</span><br />

He ran his automobilus<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And smoked his cigarettum.</span><br />
He wore a diamond studibus<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And elegant cravattum,</span><br />
A maxima cum laude shirt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And such a stylish hattum!</span><br />
<br />
He loved the luscious hic-haec-hoc,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bet on games and equi;</span><br />
At times he won at others though,<br />

<h3>A NEW SONG</h3>

<h4>OF NEW SIMILES</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
My passion is as mustard strong;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I sit all sober sad;</span><br />
Drunk as a piper all day long,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or like a March-hare mad.</span><br />
<br />
Round as a hoop the bumpers flow;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I drink, yet can't forget her;</span><br />
For though as drunk as David's sow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I love her still the better.</span><br />
<br />
Pert as a pear-monger I'd be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If Molly were but kind;</span><br />
Cool as a cucumber could see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rest of womankind.</span><br />
<br />
Like a stuck pig I gaping stare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And eye her o'er and o'er;</span><br />
Lean as a rake, with sighs and care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sleek as a mouse before.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">[Pg&nbsp;755]</a></span>

<br />
Plump as a partridge was I known,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And soft as silk my skin;</span><br />
My cheeks as fat as butter grown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as a goat now thin!</span><br />
<br />
I melancholy as a cat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Am kept awake to weep;</span><br />
But she, insensible of that,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sound as a top can sleep.</span><br />
<br />
Hard is her heart as flint or stone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She laughs to see me pale;</span><br />
And merry as a grig is grown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And brisk as bottled ale.</span><br />
<br />
The god of Love at her approach<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is busy as a bee;</span><br />
Hearts sound as any bell or roach,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are smit and sigh like me.</span><br />
<br />
Ah me! as thick as hops or hail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fine men crowd about her;</span><br />
But soon as dead as a door-nail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall I be, if without her.</span><br />
<br />
Straight as my leg her shape appears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O were we join'd together!</span><br />
My heart would be scot-free from cares,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lighter than a feather.</span><br />
<br />
As fine as five-pence is her mien,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No drum was ever tighter;</span><br />
Her glance is as the razor keen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not the sun is brighter.</span><br />
<br />
As soft as pap her kisses are,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Methinks I taste them yet;</span><br />
Brown as a berry is her hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her eyes as black as jet.</span><br />

As smooth as glass, as white as curds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her pretty hand invites;</span><br />
Sharp as her needle are her words,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her wit like pepper bites.</span><br />
<br />
Brisk as a body-louse she trips,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clean as a penny drest;</span><br />
Sweet as a rose her breath and lips,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Round as the globe her breast.</span><br />
<br />
Full as an egg was I with glee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And happy as a king:</span><br />
Good Lord! how all men envied me!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She loved like any thing.</span><br />
<br />
But false as hell, she, like the wind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Chang'd, as her sex must do;</span><br />
Though seeming as the turtle kind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And like the gospel true.</span><br />
<br />
If I and Molly could agree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let who would take Peru!</span><br />
Great as an Emperor should I be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And richer than a Jew.</span><br />
<br />
Till you grow tender as a chick,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'm dull as any post;</span><br />
Let us like burs together stick,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And warm as any toast.</span><br />
<br />
You'll know me truer than a die,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wish me better sped;</span><br />
Flat as a flounder when I lie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as a herring dead.</span><br />
<br />
Sure as a gun she'll drop a tear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sigh, perhaps, and wish,</span><br />
When I am rotten as a pear,<br />

<h3>THE AMERICAN TRAVELLER</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
To Lake Aghmoogenegamook<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All in the State of Maine,</span><br />
A man from Wittequergaugaum came<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One evening in the rain.</span><br />
<br />
"I am a traveller," said he,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Just started on a tour,</span><br />
And go to Nomjamskillicook<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To-morrow morn at four."</span><br />
<br />
He took a tavern-bed that night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, with the morrow's sun,</span><br />
By way of Sekledobskus went,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With carpet-bag and gun.</span><br />
<br />
A week passed on, and next we find<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our native tourist come</span><br />
To that sequestered village called<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Genasagarnagum.</span><br />
<br />
From thence he went to Absequoit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there&mdash;quite tired of Maine&mdash;</span><br />
He sought the mountains of Vermont,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon a railroad train.</span><br />
<br />
Dog Hollow, in the Green Mount State,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was his first stopping-place;</span><br />
And then Skunk's Misery displayed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its sweetness and its grace.</span><br />
<br />
By easy stages then he went<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To visit Devil's Den;</span><br />
And Scrabble Hollow, by the way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did come within his ken.</span><br />
<br />
Then <i>via</i> Nine Holes and Goose Green<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He travelled through the State;</span><br />
And to Virginia, finally,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was guided by his fate.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[Pg&nbsp;758]</a></span>

<br />
Within the Old Dominion's bounds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He wandered up and down;</span><br />
To-day at Buzzard's Roost ensconced,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To-morrow, at Hell Town.</span><br />
<br />
At Pole Cat, too, he spent a week,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till friends from Bull Ring came;</span><br />
And made him spend a day with them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In hunting forest-game.</span><br />
<br />
Then, with his carpet-bag in hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Dog Town next he went;</span><br />
Though stopping at Free Negro Town,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where half a day he spent.</span><br />
<br />
From thence, into Negationburg<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His route of travel lay;</span><br />
Which having gained, he left the State,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And took a southward way.</span><br />
<br />
North Carolina's friendly soil<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He trod at fall of night,</span><br />
And, on a bed of softest down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He slept at Hell's Delight.</span><br />
<br />
Morn found him on the road again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Lousy Level bound;</span><br />
At Bull's Tail, and Lick Lizard, too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Good provender he found.</span><br />
<br />
The country all about Pinch Gut<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So beautiful did seem</span><br />
That the beholder thought it like<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A picture in a dream.</span><br />
<br />
But the plantations near Burnt Coat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were even finer still,</span><br />
And made the wondering tourist feel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A soft, delicious thrill.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">[Pg&nbsp;759]</a></span>

<br />
At Tear Shirt, too, the scenery<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Most charming did appear,</span><br />
With Snatch It in the distance far,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Purgatory near.</span><br />
<br />
But, spite of all these pleasant scenes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tourist stoutly swore</span><br />
That home is brightest, after all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And travel is a bore.</span><br />
<br />
So back he went to Maine, straightway;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A little wife he took;</span><br />
And now is making nutmegs at<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Moosehicmagunticook.</span><br />

He tried to smile, but all in vain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because of a Zygomatic pain;</span><br />
And as for singing, his cheeriest tone<br />

Or else, when the pain would sharper grow,<br />

And so it is likely he did not find<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On board Xenodochy to his mind.</span><br />
The fare was poor, and he was sure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Xerofphagy he could not endure;</span><br />
Zo&ouml;phagous surely he was, I aver,<br />

Xylophagous truly he could not be&mdash;<br />

He'd have blubbered like any old Zeuglodon<br />

Be seen in the lightning, and heard in the thunder.<br />
'Twas allotted to man with his earliest breath,<br />

It begins every hope, every wish it must bound,<br />
It prays with the hermit, with monarchs is crowned;<br />
Without it the soldier, the sailor, may roam,<br />
But woe to the wretch who expels it from home.<br />
In the whisper of conscience 'tis sure to be found,<br />
Nor e'en in the whirlwind of passion is drowned;<br />
'Twill soften the heart, but, though deaf to the ear,<br />

But, in short, let it rest like a delicate flower;<br />
Oh, breathe on it softly, it dies in an hour.<br />

<h3>AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF A MAD DOG</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Good people all, of every sort,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Give ear unto my song;</span><br />
And if you find it wondrous short,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It cannot hold you long.</span><br />
<br />
In Islington there was a man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of whom the world might say</span><br />
That still a godly race he ran,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whene'er he went to pray.</span><br />
<br />
A kind and gentle heart he had,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To comfort friends and foes;</span><br />
The naked every day he clad,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he put on his clothes.</span><br />
<br />
And in that town a dog was found,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As many dogs there be,</span><br />
Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And curs of low degree.</span><br />
<br />
The dog and man at first were friends;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when a pique began,</span><br />
The dog, to gain some private ends,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went mad, and bit the man.</span><br />
<br />
Around from all the neighboring streets,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wondering neighbors ran,</span><br />
And swore the dog had lost his wits<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To bite so good a man.</span><br />
<br />
The wound it seemed both sore and sad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To every Christian eye;</span><br />
And while they swore the dog was mad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They swore the man would die.</span><br />
<br />
But soon a wonder came to light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That showed the rogues they lied;</span><br />
The man recovered of the bite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dog it was that died.</span><br />

<h3>AN EPITAPH</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Interred beneath this marble stone<br />
Lie sauntering Jack and idle Joan.<br />
While rolling threescore years and one<br />
Did round this globe their courses run.<br />
If human things went ill or well,<br />
If changing empires rose or fell,<br />
The morning past, the evening came,<br />
And found this couple just the same.<br />
They walked and ate, good folks. What then?<br />
Why, then they walked and ate again;<br />
They soundly slept the night away;<br />
They did just nothing all the day,<br />
Nor sister either had, nor brother;<br />
They seemed just tallied for each other.<br />
Their moral and economy<br />
Most perfectly they made agree;<br />
Each virtue kept its proper bound,<br />
Nor trespassed on the other's ground.<br />
Nor fame nor censure they regarded;<br />
They neither punished nor rewarded.<br />
He cared not what the footman did;<br />
Her maids she neither praised nor chid;<br />
So every servant took his course,<br />
And, bad at first, they all grew worse;<br />
Slothful disorder filled his stable,<br />
And sluttish plenty decked her table.<br />
Their beer was strong, their wine was port;<br />
Their meal was large, their grace was short.<br />
They gave the poor the remnant meat,<br />
Just when it grew not fit to eat.<br />
They paid the church and parish rate,<br />
And took, but read not, the receipt;<br />
For which they claimed their Sunday's due<br />
Of slumbering in an upper pew.<br />
No man's defects sought they to know,<br />
So never made themselves a foe.<br />
No man's good deeds did they commend,<br />
So never raised themselves a friend.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">[Pg&nbsp;766]</a></span>

Nor cherished they relations poor,<br />
That might decrease their present store;<br />
Nor barn nor house did they repair,<br />
That might oblige their future heir.<br />
They neither added nor confounded;<br />
They neither wanted nor abounded.<br />
Nor tear nor smile did they employ<br />
At news of grief or public joy<br />
When bells were rung and bonfires made,<br />
If asked, they ne'er denied their aid;<br />
Their jug was to the ringers carried,<br />
Whoever either died or married.<br />
Their billet at the fire was found,<br />
Whoever was deposed or crowned.<br />
Nor good, nor bad, nor fools, nor wise;<br />
They would not learn, nor could advise;<br />
Without love, hatred, joy, or fear,<br />
They led&mdash;a kind of&mdash;as it were;<br />
Nor wished, nor cared, nor laughed, nor cried.<br />
And so they lived, and so they died.<br />

<h3>OLD GRIMES</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Old Grimes is dead; that good old man<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We never shall see more:</span><br />
He used to wear a long, black coat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All button'd down before.</span><br />
<br />
His heart was open as the day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His feelings all were true;</span><br />
His hair was some inclined to gray&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He wore it in a queue.</span><br />
<br />
Whene'er he heard the voice of pain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His breast with pity burn'd;</span><br />
The large, round head upon his cane<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From ivory was turn'd.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">[Pg&nbsp;767]</a></span>

<br />
Kind words he ever had for all;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He knew no base design:</span><br />
His eyes were dark and rather small,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His nose was aquiline.</span><br />
<br />
He lived at peace with all mankind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In friendship he was true:</span><br />
His coat had pocket-holes behind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His pantaloons were blue.</span><br />
<br />
Unharm'd, the sin which earth pollutes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He pass'd securely o'er,</span><br />
And never wore a pair of boots<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For thirty years or more.</span><br />
<br />
But good old Grimes is now at rest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor fears misfortune's frown:</span><br />
He wore a double-breasted vest&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The stripes ran up and down.</span><br />
<br />
He modest merit sought to find,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Any pay it its desert:</span><br />
He had no malice in his mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No ruffles on his shirt.</span><br />
<br />
His neighbors he did not abuse&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was sociable and gay:</span><br />
He wore large buckles on his shoes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And changed them every day.</span><br />
<br />
His knowledge, hid from public gaze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He did not bring to view,</span><br />
Nor made a noise, town-meeting days,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As many people do.</span><br />
<br />
His worldly goods he never threw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In trust to fortune's chances,</span><br />
But lived (as all his brothers do)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In easy circumstances.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">[Pg&nbsp;768]</a></span>

<br />
Thus undisturb'd by anxious cares,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His peaceful moments ran;</span><br />
And everybody said he was<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A fine old gentleman.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Four hundred thousand men and more</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Dukes by the score;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Princes a few, and Kings one or two;</span><br />
While the fields are so green, and the sky so blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Morbleu! Parbleu!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What a pleasant excursion to Moscow!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There was Junot and Augereau,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Heigh-ho for Moscow!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dombrowsky and Poniatowsky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Marshall Ney, lack-a-day!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">General Rapp, and the Emperor Nap;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Nothing would do,</span><br />
While the fields were so green, and the sky so blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Morbleu! Parbleu!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Nothing would do</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For the whole of his crew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But they must be marching to Moscow.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Emperor Nap he talk'd so big</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That he frighten'd Mr. Roscoe.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">John Bull, he cries, if you'll be wise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ask the Emperor Nap if he will please</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To grant you peace upon your knees,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Because he is going to Moscow!</span><br />
He'll make all the Poles come out of their holes,<br />
And beat the Russians, and eat the Prussians;<br />
For the fields are green, and the sky is blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Morbleu! Parbleu!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he'll certainly march to Moscow!</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">[Pg&nbsp;776]</a></span>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Counsellor Brougham was all in a fume</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the thought of the march to Moscow:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Russians, he said, they were undone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the great Fee-Faw-Fum</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Would presently come,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a hop, step, and jump, unto London,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For, as for his conquering Russia,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">However some persons might scoff it,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Do it he could, do it he would,</span><br />
And from doing it nothing would come but good,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And nothing could call him off it.</span><br />
Mr. Jeffrey said so, who must certainly know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For he was the Edinburgh Prophet.</span><br />
They all of them knew Mr. Jeffrey's Review,<br />
Which with Holy Writ ought to be reckon'd:<br />
It was, through thick and thin, to its party true,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its back was buff, and its sides were blue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Morbleu! Parbleu!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It served them for law and for gospel too.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the Russians stoutly they turned to</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Upon the road to Moscow.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nap had to fight his way all through;</span><br />
They could fight, though they could not parlez-vous;<br />
But the fields were green, and the sky was blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Morbleu! Parbleu!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And so he got to Moscow.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He found the place too warm for him,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For they set fire to Moscow.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To get there had cost him much ado,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then no better course he knew</span><br />
While the fields were green, and the sky was blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Morbleu! Parbleu!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But to march back again from Moscow.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Markoff he mark'd them off,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Krosnoff he cross'd them off,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, last of all, an Admiral came,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A terrible man with a terrible name,</span><br />
A name which you all know by sight very well,<br />
But which no one can speak, and no one can spell.<br />
They stuck close to Nap with all their might;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They were on the left and on the right</span><br />
Behind and before, and by day and by night;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He would rather parlez-vous than fight;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he look'd white, and he look'd blue.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Morbleu! Parbleu!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When parlez-vous no more would do.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For they remember'd Moscow.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And then came on the frost and snow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">All on the road from Moscow.</span><br />
The wind and the weather he found, in that hour,<br />
Cared nothing for him, nor for all his power;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">[Pg&nbsp;778]</a></span>

For him who, while Europe crouch'd under his rod,<br />
Put his trust in his Fortune, and not in his God.<br />
Worse and worse every day the elements grew,<br />
The fields were so white and the sky was so blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Sacrebleu! Ventrebleu!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What a horrible journey from Moscow!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What then thought the Emperor Nap</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Upon the road from Moscow?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why, I ween he thought it small delight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To fight all day, and to freeze all night;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he was besides in a very great fright,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For a whole skin he liked to be in;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And so not knowing what else to do,</span><br />
When the fields were so white, and the sky so blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Morbleu! Parbleu!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He stole away,&mdash;I tell you true,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Upon the road from Moscow.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis myself, quoth he, I must mind most;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So the devil may take the hindmost.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Too cold upon the road was he;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Too hot had he been at Moscow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But colder and hotter he may be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For the grave is colder than Moscovy;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And a place there is to be kept in view,</span><br />
Where the fire is red, and the brimstone blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Morbleu! Parbleu!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Which he must go to,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">If the Pope say true,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If he does not in time look about him;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where his namesake almost</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He may have for his Host;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He has reckon'd too long without him;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If that Host get him in Purgatory,</span><br />
He won't leave him there alone with his glory;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But there he must stay for a very long day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For from thence there is no stealing away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As there was on the road from Moscow.</span><br />

<h3>ON THE OXFORD CARRIER</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Here lieth one, who did most truly prove<br />
That he could never die while he could move;<br />
So hung his destiny never to rot<br />
While he might still jog on and keep his trot;<br />
Made of sphere metal, never to decay<br />
Until his revolution was at stay.<br />
Time numbers motion, yet (without a crime<br />
'Gainst old truth) motion number'd out his time<br />
And like an engine moved with wheel and weight,<br />
His principles being ceased, he ended straight.<br />
Rest, that gives all men life, gave him his death,<br />
And too much breathing put him out of breath;<br />
Nor were it contradiction to affirm,<br />
Too long vacation hasten'd on his term.<br />
Merely to drive the time away he sicken'd,<br />
Fainted, and died, nor would with ale be quicken'd;<br />
"Nay," quoth he, on his swooning bed outstretch'd,<br />
"If I mayn't carry, sure I'll ne'er be fetch'd,<br />
But vow, though the cross doctors all stood hearers,<br />
For one carrier put down to make six bearers."<br />
Ease was his chief disease; and to judge right,<br />
He died for heaviness that his cart went light:<br />
His leisure told him that his time was come.<br />
And lack of load made his life burdensome.<br />
That even to his last breath (there be that say't),<br />
As he were press'd to death, he cried, "More weight;"<br />
But, had his doings lasted as they were,<br />
He had been an immortal carrier.<br />
Obedient to the moon he spent his date<br />
In course reciprocal, and had his fate<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">[Pg&nbsp;781]</a></span>

Link'd to the mutual flowing of the seas,<br />
Yet (strange to think) his wane was his increase:<br />
His letters are deliver'd all, and gone,<br />
Only remains the superscription.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">3. By turns we catch the vital breath and die&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">4. The cradle and the tomb, alas! so nigh.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">5. To be, is better far than not to be.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">6. Though all man's life may seem a tragedy;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">7. But light cares speak when mighty griefs are dumb,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">8. The bottom is but shallow whence they come.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">9. Your fate is but the common lot of all:</span><br />
10. Unmingled joys here to no man befall,<br />
11. Nature to each allots his proper sphere;<br />
12. Fortune makes folly her peculiar care;<br />
13. Custom does often reason overrule,<br />
14. And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool.<br />
15. Live well; how long or short, permit to Heaven;<br />
16. They who forgive most, shall be most forgiven.<br />
17. Sin may be clasped so close we cannot see its face&mdash;<br />
18. Vile intercourse where virtue has no place.<br />
19. Then keep each passion down, however dear;<br />
20. Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear.<br />
21. Her sensual snares, let faithless pleasure lay,<br />
22. With craft and skill, to ruin and betray;<br />
23. Soar not too high to fall, but stoop to rise.<br />
24. We masters grow of all that we despise.<br />
25. Oh, then, renounce that impious self-esteem;<br />
26. Riches have wings, and grandeur is a dream.<br />
27. Think not ambition wise because 'tis brave,<br />
28. The paths of glory lead but to the grave.<br />
29. What is ambition?&mdash;'tis a glorious cheat!&mdash;<br />
30. Only destructive to the brave and great.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">[Pg&nbsp;784]</a></span>

31. What's all the gaudy glitter of a crown?<br />
32. The way to bliss lies not on beds of down.<br />
33. How long we live, not years but actions tell;<br />
34. That man lives twice who lives the first life well.<br />
35. Make, then, while yet ye may, your God your friend,<br />
36. Whom Christians worship yet not comprehend.<br />
37. The trust that's given guard, and to yourself be just;<br />
38. For, live we how we can, yet die we must.<br />

Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To point a moral or adorn a tale.</span><br />

Full many a gem of purest ray serene,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears,</span><br />
Like angels' visits, few and far between,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deck the long vista of departed years.</span><br />
<br />
Man never is, but always to be bless'd;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tenth transmitter of a foolish face,</span><br />
Like Aaron's serpent, swallows up the rest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And makes a sunshine in the shady place.</span><br />
<br />
For man the hermit sigh'd, till woman smiled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To waft a feather or to drown a fly,</span><br />
(In wit a man, simplicity a child,)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With silent finger pointing to the sky.</span><br />

But fools rush in where angels fear to tread<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the Norman Baron lay,</span><br />
Loud, without, his men were crying,<br />

Know you why the ploughman, fretting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Homeward plods his weary way</span><br />
Ere his time? He's after getting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shorter hours and better pay.</span><br />

See! the <i>Hesperus</i> is swinging<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Idle in the wintry bay,</span><br />
And the skipper's daughter's singing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Shorter hours and better pay."</span><br />
<br />
Where's the minstrel boy? I've found him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Joining in the labour fray</span><br />
With his placards slung around him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Shorter hours and better pay."</span><br />
<br />
Oh, young Lochinvar is coming;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though his hair is getting grey,</span><br />
Yet I'm glad to hear him humming,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Shorter hours and, better pay."</span><br />

E'en the boy upon the burning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deck has got a word to say,</span><br />
Something rather cross concerning<br />

Lives of great men all remind us<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And walk about in Wales."</span><br />
<br />
Now Ben had sailed to many a place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That's underneath the world;</span><br />
But in two years the ship came home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all her sails were furled.</span><br />
<br />
But when he called on Sally Brown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To see how she got on,</span><br />
He found she'd got another Ben,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose Christian name was John.</span><br />
<br />
"O, Sally Brown, O, Sally Brown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How could you serve me so?</span><br />
I've met with many a breeze before,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But never such a blow!"</span><br />
<br />
Then reading on his 'bacco-box,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He heaved a heavy sigh,</span><br />
And then began to eye his pipe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then to pipe his eye.</span><br />
<br />
And then he tried to sing "All's Well,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But could not, though he tried;</span><br />
His head was turned, and so he chewed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His pigtail till he died.</span><br />
<br />
His death, which happened in his berth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At forty-odd befell:</span><br />
They went and told the sexton, and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sexton tolled the bell.</span><br />

<h3>TIM TURPIN</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Tim Turpin he was gravel blind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ne'er had seen the skies:</span><br />
For Nature, when his head was made,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forgot to dot his eyes.</span><br />
<br />
So, like a Christmas pedagogue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor Tim was forced to do,&mdash;</span><br />
Look out for pupils, for he had<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A vacancy for two.</span><br />
<br />
There's some have specs to help their sight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of objects dim and small;</span><br />
But Tim had <i>specks</i> within his eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And could not see at all.</span><br />
<br />
Now Tim he wooed a servant maid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And took her to his arms;</span><br />
For he, like Pyramus, had cast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A wall-eye on her charms.</span><br />
<br />
By day she led him up and down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where'er he wished to jog,</span><br />
A happy wife, although she led<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The life of any dog.</span><br />
<br />
But just when Tim had lived a month<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In honey with his wife,</span><br />
A surgeon oped his Milton eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like oysters, with a knife.</span><br />
<br />
But when his eyes were opened thus,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He wished them dark again;</span><br />
For when he looked upon his wife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He saw her very plain.</span><br />
<br />
Her face was bad, her figure worse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He couldn't bear to eat;</span><br />
For she was anything but like<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A Grace before his meat.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_796" id="Page_796">[Pg&nbsp;796]</a></span>

<br />
Now Tim he was a feeling man:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For when his sight was thick,</span><br />
It made him feel for everything,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But that was with a stick.</span><br />
<br />
So, with a cudgel in his hand,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was not light or slim,&mdash;</span><br />
He knocked at his wife's head until<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It opened unto him.</span><br />
<br />
And when the corpse was stiff and cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He took his slaughtered spouse,</span><br />
And laid her in a heap with all<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ashes of her house.</span><br />
<br />
But, like a wicked murderer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He lived in constant fear</span><br />
From day to day, and so he cut<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His throat from ear to ear.</span><br />
<br />
The neighbors fetched a doctor in:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said he, "This wound I dread</span><br />
Can hardly be sewed up,&mdash;his life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is hanging on a thread."</span><br />
<br />
But when another week was gone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He gave him stronger hope,&mdash;</span><br />
Instead of hanging on a thread,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of hanging on a rope.</span><br />
<br />
Ah! when he hid his bloody work,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In ashes round about,</span><br />
How little he supposed the truth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would soon be sifted out!</span><br />
<br />
But when the parish dustman came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His rubbish to withdraw,</span><br />
He found more dust within the heap<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than he contracted for!</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_797" id="Page_797">[Pg&nbsp;797]</a></span>

<br />
A dozen men to try the fact,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were sworn that very day;</span><br />
But though they all were jurors, yet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No conjurors were they.</span><br />
<br />
Said Tim unto those jurymen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You need not waste your breath,</span><br />
For I confess myself, at once,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The author of her death.</span><br />
<br />
"And O, when I reflect upon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The blood that I have spilt,</span><br />
Just like a button is my soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Inscribed with double <i>guilt</i>!"</span><br />
<br />
Then turning round his head again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He saw before his eyes</span><br />
A great judge, and a little judge,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The judges of a-size!</span><br />
<br />
The great judge took his judgment-cap,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And put it on his head,</span><br />
And sentenced Tim by law to hang<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till he was three times dead.</span><br />
<br />
So he was tried, and he was hung<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Fit punishment for such)</span><br />
On Horsham drop, and none can say<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was a drop too much.</span><br />

<h3>FAITHLESS NELLY GRAY</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Ben Battle was a soldier bold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And used to war's alarms:</span><br />
But a cannon-ball took off his legs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So he laid down his arms!</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">[Pg&nbsp;798]</a></span>

<br />
Now, as they bore him off the field,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said he, "Let others shoot,</span><br />
For here I leave my second leg,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Forty-second Foot!"</span><br />
<br />
The army surgeons made him limbs:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said he, "They're only pegs;</span><br />
But there's as wooden members quite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As represent my legs!"</span><br />
<br />
Now Ben he loved a pretty maid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her name was Nelly Gray;</span><br />
So he went to pay her his devours<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he'd devoured his pay!</span><br />
<br />
But when he called on Nelly Gray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She made him quite a scoff;</span><br />
And when she saw his wooden legs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Began to take them off!</span><br />
<br />
"O Nelly Gray! O Nelly Gray!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is this your love so warm?</span><br />
The love that loves a scarlet coat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should be more uniform!"</span><br />
<br />
Said she, "I loved a soldier once,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he was blithe and brave;</span><br />
But I will never have a man<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With both legs in the grave!</span><br />
<br />
"Before you had those timber toes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your love I did allow,</span><br />
But then you know, you stand upon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Another footing now!"</span><br />
<br />
"O Nelly Gray! O Nelly Gray!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For all your jeering speeches,</span><br />
At duty's call I left my legs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Badajos's breaches!"</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">[Pg&nbsp;799]</a></span>

<br />
"Why, then," said she, "you've lost the feet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of legs in war's alarms,</span><br />
And now you cannot wear your shoes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon your feats of arms!"</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, false and fickle Nelly Gray;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I know why you refuse:</span><br />
Though I've no feet&mdash;some other man<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is standing in my shoes!</span><br />
<br />
"I wish I ne'er had seen your face;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now a long farewell!</span><br />
For you will be my death&mdash;alas!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You will not be my Nell!"</span><br />
<br />
Now, when he went from Nelly Gray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His heart so heavy got&mdash;</span><br />
And life was such a burden grown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It made him take a knot!</span><br />
<br />
So round his melancholy neck<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A rope he did entwine,</span><br />
And, for his second time in life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Enlisted in the Line!</span><br />
<br />
One end he tied around a beam,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then removed his pegs,</span><br />
And as his legs were off,&mdash;of course,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He soon was off his legs!</span><br />
<br />
And there he hung till he was dead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As any nail in town,&mdash;</span><br />
For though distress had cut him up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It could not cut him down!</span><br />
<br />
A dozen men sat on his corpse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To find out why he died&mdash;</span><br />
And they buried Ben in four cross-roads,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a stake in his inside!</span><br />

<h3>DEATH'S RAMBLE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
One day the dreary old King of Death<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Inclined for some sport with the carnal,</span><br />
So he tied a pack of darts on his back,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And quietly stole from his charnel.</span><br />
<br />
His head was bald of flesh and of hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His body was lean and lank;</span><br />
His joints at each stir made a crack, and the cur<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Took a gnaw, by the way, at his shank.</span><br />
<br />
And what did he do with his deadly darts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This goblin of grisly bone?</span><br />
He dabbled and spilled man's blood, and he killed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a butcher that kills his own.</span><br />
<br />
The first he slaughtered it made him laugh<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(For the man was a coffin-maker),</span><br />
To think how the mutes, and men in black suits,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would mourn for an undertaker.</span><br />
<br />
Death saw two Quakers sitting at church;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quoth he, "We shall not differ."</span><br />
And he let them alone, like figures of stone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he could not make them stiffer.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802">[Pg&nbsp;802]</a></span>

<br />
He saw two duellists going to fight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In fear they could not smother;</span><br />
And he shot one through at once&mdash;for he knew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They never would shoot each other.</span><br />
<br />
He saw a watchman fast in his box,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he gave a snore infernal;</span><br />
Said Death, "He may keep his breath, for his sleep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can never be more eternal."</span><br />
<br />
He met a coachman driving a coach<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So slow that his fare grew sick;</span><br />
But he let him stray on his tedious way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Death only wars on the <i>quick</i>.</span><br />
<br />
Death saw a tollman taking a toll,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the spirit of his fraternity;</span><br />
But he knew that sort of man would extort,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though summoned to all eternity.</span><br />
<br />
He found an author writing his life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he let him write no further;</span><br />
For Death, who strikes whenever he likes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is jealous of all self-murther!</span><br />
<br />
Death saw a patient that pulled out his purse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a doctor that took the sum;</span><br />
But he let them be&mdash;for he knew that the "fee"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was a prelude to "faw" and "fum."</span><br />
<br />
He met a dustman ringing a bell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he gave him a mortal thrust;</span><br />
For himself, by law, since Adam's flaw,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is contractor for all our dust.</span><br />
<br />
He saw a sailor mixing his grog,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he marked him out for slaughter;</span><br />
For on water he scarcely had cared for death,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never on rum-and-water.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">[Pg&nbsp;803]</a></span>

<br />
Death saw two players playing at cards,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the game wasn't worth a dump,</span><br />
For he quickly laid them flat with a spade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To wait for the final trump!</span><br />

And then, they caused me cast out many placks,<br />
And made me pay for four-and-twenty acts.<br />
But, ere they came half gait to Concludendum,<br />
The fiend one plack was left for to defend him.<br />
Thus they postponed me two years, with their train,<br />
Then, hodie ad octo, bade me come again,<br />
And then, these rooks, they roupit wonder fast,<br />
For sentence silver, they cri&eacute;d at the last.<br />

John Bull for pastime took a prance,<br />
Some time ago, to peep at France;<br />
To talk of sciences and arts,<br />
And knowledge gain'd in foreign parts.<br />
Monsieur, obsequious, heard him speak,<br />
And answer'd John in heathen Greek:<br />
To all he ask'd, 'bout all he saw,<br />
'Twas, <i>Monsieur, je vous n'entends pas</i>.<br />
<br />
John, to the Palais-Royal come,<br />
Its splendor almost struck him dumb.<br />
"I say, whose house is that there here?"<br />
"House! <i>Je vous n'entends pas, Monsieur.</i>"<br />
"What, Nongtongpaw again!" cries John;<br />
"This fellow is some mighty Don:<br />
No doubt he's plenty for the maw,<br />
I'll breakfast with this Nongtongpaw."<br />
<br />
John saw Versailles from Marli's height,<br />
And cried, astonish'd at the sight,<br />
"Whose fine estate is that there here?"<br />
"State! <i>Je vous n'entends pas, Monsieur.</i>"<br />
"His? what! the land and houses, too?<br />
The fellow's richer than a Jew:<br />
On <i>everything</i> he lays his claw!<br />
I'd like to dine with Nongtongpaw."<br />
<br />
Next tripping came a courtly fair,<br />
John cried, enchanted with her air,<br />
"What lovely wench is that there here?"<br />

A palace, lands, and then a wife<br />
Sir Joshua might delight to draw!<br />
I'd like to sup with Nongtongpaw."<br />
<br />
"But hold! whose funeral's that?" cries John.<br />
"<i>Je vous n'entends pas.</i>"&mdash;"What! is he gone?<br />
Wealth, fame, and beauty could not save<br />
Poor Nongtongpaw then from the grave!<br />
His race is run, his game is up,&mdash;<br />

But since he chooses to withdraw,<br />
Good night t'ye, Mounseer Nongtongpaw!"<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That is, if you should like it.</span><br />
<br />
La Galisse was, indeed, I grant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not used to any dainty,</span><br />
When he was born; but could not want<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As long as he had plenty.</span><br />
<br />
Instructed with the greatest care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He always was well bred,</span><br />
And never used a hat to wear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when 'twas on his head.</span><br />
<br />
His temper was exceeding good,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just of his father's fashion;</span><br />
And never quarrels boiled his blood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Except when in a passion.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">[Pg&nbsp;815]</a></span>

His mind was on devotion bent;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He kept with care each high day,</span><br />
And Holy Thursday always spent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The day before Good Friday.</span><br />
<br />
He liked good claret very well,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I just presume to think it;</span><br />
For ere its flavour he could tell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He thought it best to drink it.</span><br />
<br />
Than doctors more he loved the cook,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though food would make him gross,</span><br />
And never any physic took<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when he took a dose.</span><br />

Oh, happy, happy is the swain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ladies so adore;</span><br />
For many followed in his train<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whene'er he walked before.</span><br />
<br />
Bright as the sun his flowing hair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In golden ringlets shone;</span><br />
And no one could with him compare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If he had been alone.</span><br />
<br />
His talents I cannot rehearse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But every one allows</span><br />
That whatsoe'er he wrote in verse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No one could call it prose.</span><br />
<br />
He argued with precision nice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The learned all declare;</span><br />
And it was his decision wise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No horse could be a mare.</span><br />
<br />
His powerful logic would surprise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amaze, and much delight:</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was hurtful to the sight.</span><br />

And those did never want their ears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who any time had heard him.</span><br />
<br />
He was not always right, 'tis true,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then he must be wrong;</span><br />
But none had found it out, he knew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If he had held his tongue.</span><br />
<br />
Whene'er a tender tear he shed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas certain that he wept;</span><br />
And he would lie awake in bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unless, indeed, he slept.</span><br />
<br />
In tilting everybody knew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His very high renown;</span><br />
Yet no opponents he o'erthrew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But those that he knocked down.</span><br />
<br />
At last they smote him in the head,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What hero ever fought all?</span><br />
And when they saw that he was dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They knew the wound was mortal.</span><br />
<br />
And when at last he lost his breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It closed his every strife;</span><br />
For that sad day that sealed his death<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deprived him of his life.</span><br />

Who tortures heavenly music,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And makes it a thing of woe;</span><br />

<h3>THE ART OF BOOK-KEEPING</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
How hard, when those who do not wish<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To lend, that's lose, their books,</span><br />
Are snared by anglers&mdash;folks that fish<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With literary hooks;</span><br />
<br />
Who call and take some favourite tome,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But never read it through;</span><br />
They thus complete their set at home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By making one at you.</span><br />
<br />
Behold the bookshelf of a dunce<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who borrows&mdash;never lends;</span><br />
Yon work, in twenty volumes, once<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Belonged to twenty friends.</span><br />
<br />
New tales and novels you may shut<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From view&mdash;'tis all in vain;</span><br />
They're gone&mdash;and though the leaves are "cut"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They never "come again."</span><br />
<br />
For pamphlets lent I look around,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For tracts my tears are spilt;</span><br />
But when they take a book that's bound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis surely extra guilt.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_819" id="Page_819">[Pg&nbsp;819]</a></span>

<br />
A circulating library<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is mine&mdash;my birds are flown;</span><br />
There's one odd volume left, to be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like all the rest, a-lone.</span><br />
<br />
I, of my "Spenser" quite bereft,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Last winter sore was shaken;</span><br />
Of "Lamb" I've but a quarter left,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor could I save my "Bacon."</span><br />
<br />
My "Hall" and "Hill" were levelled flat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But "Moore" was still the cry;</span><br />
And then, although I threw them "Sprat,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They swallowed up my "Pye."</span><br />
<br />
O'er everything, however slight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They seized some airy trammel;</span><br />
They snatched my "Hogg" and "Fox" one night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pocketed my "Campbell."</span><br />
<br />
And then I saw my "Crabbe" at last,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like Hamlet's, backward go;</span><br />
And as my tide was ebbing fast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of course I lost my "Rowe."</span><br />
<br />
I wondered into what balloon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My books their course had bent;</span><br />
And yet, with all my marvelling, soon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I found my "Marvell" went.</span><br />
<br />
My "Mallet" served to knock me down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which makes me thus a talker;</span><br />
And once, while I was out of town,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My "Johnson" proved a "Walker."</span><br />
<br />
While studying o'er the fire one day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My "Hobbes" amidst the smoke;</span><br />
They bore my "Colman" clean away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And carried off my "Coke."</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_820" id="Page_820">[Pg&nbsp;820]</a></span>

<br />
They picked my "Locke," to me far more<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than Bramah's patent's worth;</span><br />
And now my losses I deplore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without a "Home" on earth.</span><br />
<br />
If once a book you let them lift,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Another they conceal,</span><br />
For though I caught them stealing "Swift,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As swiftly went my "Steele."</span><br />
<br />
"Hope" is not now upon my shelf,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where late he stood elated;</span><br />
But, what is strange, my "Pope" himself<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is excommunicated.</span><br />
<br />
My little "Suckling" in the grave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is sunk, to swell the ravage;</span><br />
And what 'twas Crusoe's fate to save<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas mine to lose&mdash;a "Savage."</span><br />
<br />
Even "Glover's" works I cannot put<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My frozen hands upon;</span><br />
Though ever since I lost my "Foote,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My "Bunyan" has been gone.</span><br />
<br />
My "Hoyle" with "Cotton" went; oppressed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My "Taylor" too must fail;</span><br />
To save my "Goldsmith" from arrest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In vain I offered "Bayle."</span><br />
<br />
I "Prior," sought, but could not see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The "Hood" so late in front;</span><br />
And when I turned to hunt for "Lee,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! where was my "Leigh Hunt!"</span><br />
<br />
I tried to laugh, old care to tickle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet could not "Tickell" touch;</span><br />
And then, alas! I missed my "Mickle,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And surely mickle's much.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">[Pg&nbsp;821]</a></span>

<br />
'Tis quite enough my griefs to feed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My sorrows to excuse,</span><br />
To think I cannot read my "Reid,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor even use my "Hughes."</span><br />
<br />
To "West," to "South," I turn my head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Exposed alike to odd jeers;</span><br />
For since my "Roger Ascham's" fled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I ask 'em for my "Rogers."</span><br />
<br />
They took my "Horne"&mdash;and "Horne Tooke" too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus my treasures flit;</span><br />
I feel when I would "Hazlitt" view,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The flames that it has lit.</span><br />
<br />
My word's worth little, "Wordsworth" gone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If I survive its doom;</span><br />
How many a bard I doted on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was swept off&mdash;with my "Broome."</span><br />
<br />
My classics would not quiet lie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A thing so fondly hoped;</span><br />
Like Dr. Primrose, I may cry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"My 'Livy' has eloped!"</span><br />
<br />
My life is wasting fast away&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I suffer from these shocks;</span><br />
And though I fixed a lock on "Grey"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's grey upon my locks.</span><br />
<br />
I'm far from young&mdash;am growing pale&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I see my "Butter" fly;</span><br />
And when they ask about my <i>ail</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis "Burton" I reply.</span><br />
<br />
They still have made me slight returns,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus my griefs divide;</span><br />
For oh! they've cured me of my "Burns,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And eased my "Akenside."</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_822" id="Page_822">[Pg&nbsp;822]</a></span>

<br />
But all I think I shall not say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor let my anger burn;</span><br />
For as they never found me "Gay,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They have not left me "Sterne."</span><br />

Even is come; and from the dark Park, hark,<br />
The signal of the setting sun&mdash;one gun!<br />
And six is sounding from the chime, prime time<br />
To go and see the Drury-Lane, Dane slain,&mdash;<br />
Or hear Othello's jealous doubt spout out,&mdash;<br />
Or Macbeth raving at that shade-made blade,<br />
Denying to his frantic clutch much touch;&mdash;<br />
Or else to see Ducrow with wide stride ride<br />
Four horses as no other man can span;<br />
Or in the small Olympic Pit, sit split<br />
Laughing at Liston, while you quiz his phiz.<br />
Anon Night comes, and with her wings brings things<br />
Such as, with his poetic tongue, Young sung;<br />
The gas up-blazes with its bright white light,<br />
And paralytic watchmen prowl, howl, growl,<br />
About the streets and take up Pall-Mall Sal,<br />
Who, hasting to her nightly jobs, robs fobs.<br />
<br />
Now thieves to enter for your cash, smash, crash,<br />
Past drowsy Charley, in a deep sleep, creep,<br />
But frightened by Policeman B 3, flee,<br />
And while they're going, whisper low, "No go!"<br />
Now puss, while folks are in their beds, treads leads.<br />
And sleepers waking, grumble&mdash;"Drat that cat!"<br />
Who in the gutter caterwauls, squalls, mauls<br />
Some feline foe, and screams in shrill ill-will.<br />
<br />
Now Bulls of Bashan, of a prize size, rise<br />
In childish dreams, and with a roar gore poor<br />
Georgy, or Charley, or Billy, willy-nilly;&mdash;<br />
But Nursemaid, in a nightmare rest, chest-pressed,<br />
Dreameth of one of her old flames, James Games,<br />
And that she hears&mdash;what faith is man's!&mdash;Ann's banns<br />
And his, from Reverend Mr. Rice, twice, thrice:<br />
White ribbons flourish, and a stout shout out,<br />
That upward goes, shows Rose knows those bows' woes!<br />

<h3>CAUTIONARY VERSES</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p class='poem'>My little dears, who learn to read, pray early, learn to shun</p>
<p class='poem'>That very silly thing indeed which people call a pun;</p>
<p class='poem'>Read Entick's rules, and 'twill be found how simple an offence</p>
<p class='poem'>It is to make the selfsame sound afford a double sense.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>For instance, ale may make you ail, your aunt an ant may kill,</p>
<p class='poem'>You in a vale may buy a veil and Bill may pay the bill.</p>
<p class='poem'>Or if to France your bark you steer, at Dover it may be</p>
<p class='poem'>A peer appears upon the pier, who blind, still goes to sea.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>Thus, one might say, when, to a treat, good friends accept our greeting,</p>
<p class='poem'>'Tis meet that men who meet to eat should eat their meat when meeting;</p>
<p class='poem'>Brawn on the board's no bore indeed, although from boar prepared;</p>
<p class='poem'>Nor can the fowl on which we feed, foul feeding be declared.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>Thus one ripe fruit may be a pear, and yet be pared again,</p>
<p class='poem'>And still be one, which seemeth rare until we do explain.</p>
<p class='poem'>It therefore should be all your aim to speak with ample care,</p>
<p class='poem'>For who, however fond of game, would choose to swallow hair?</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>A fat man's gait may make us smile, who have no gate to close;</p>
<p class='poem'>The farmer sitting on his stile no stylish person knows.</p>
<p class='poem'>Perfumers men of scents must be; some Scilly men are bright;</p>
<p class='poem'>A brown man oft deep read we see, a black a wicked wight.</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">[Pg&nbsp;829]</a></span>

</p>
<p class='poem'>Most wealthy men good manors have, however vulgar they;</p>
<p class='poem'>And actors still the harder slave the oftener they play;</p>
<p class='poem'>So poets can't the baize obtain, unless their tailors choose;</p>
<p class='poem'>While grooms and coachmen, not in vain, each evening seek the Mews.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>The dyer, who by dyeing lives, a dire life maintains;</p>
<p class='poem'>The glazier, it is known, receives his profits for his panes;</p>
<p class='poem'>By gardeners thyme is tied, 'tis true, when spring is in its prime,</p>
<p class='poem'>But time or tide won't wait for you if you are tied for time.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>Then now you see, my little dears, the way to make a pun;</p>
<p class='poem'>A trick which you, through coming years, should sedulously shun;</p>
<p class='poem'>The fault admits of no defence; for wheresoe'er 'tis found,</p>
<p class='poem'>You sacrifice for sound the sense; the sense is never sound.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>So let your words and actions too, one single meaning prove,</p>
<p class='poem'>And, just in all you say or do, you'll gain esteem and love;</p>
<p class='poem'>In mirth and play no harm you'll know when duty's task is done,</p>
<p class='poem'>But parents ne'er should let you go unpunished for a pun!</p>

<br />
Ah, no!&mdash;for in Maine I will find thee<br />

Night saw the crew like pedlers with their packs<br />

Walk crank along with coffin on their backs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While in their arms they bow their weary legs.</span><br />

And yet 'twas strange, and scarce can one suppose<br />

His white jean breeches and black woollen hose,<br />

<br />
But, Holy Father! what shall save the soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When cobblers ask three dollars for their shoes?</span><br />
When cooks their biscuits with a shot-tower roll,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And farmers rake their hay-cocks with their hoes.</span><br />

And graper and graper, alas! grew he,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cursed the day he was born.</span><br />
His crute was clum and his voice was rum,<br />

And it stuck in the woggly bird's umptum lorn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And weepadge, the smart did thrill.</span><br />
He fumbled and cursed, but that wasn't the worst,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he couldn't at all get free,</span><br />
And he cried, "I am gammed, and injustibly nammed<br />

<br />
And there he sits still, with no worm in his bill,<br />

He is hungry and bare, and gobliddered with care,<br />

<h3>THE CUMBERBUNCE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
I strolled beside the shining sea,<br />
I was as lonely as could be;<br />
No one to cheer me in my walk<br />
But stones and sand, which cannot talk&mdash;<br />
Sand and stones and bits of shell,<br />
Which never have a thing to tell.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845">[Pg&nbsp;845]</a></span>

<br />
But as I sauntered by the tide<br />
I saw a something at my side,<br />
A something green, and blue, and pink,<br />
And brown, and purple, too, I think.<br />
I would not say how large it was;<br />
I would not venture that, because<br />
It took me rather by surprise,<br />
And I have not the best of eyes.<br />
<br />
Should you compare it to a cat,<br />
I'd say it was as large as that;<br />
Or should you ask me if the thing<br />
Was smaller than a sparrow's wing,<br />
I should be apt to think you knew,<br />
And simply answer, "Very true!"<br />
<br />
Well, as I looked upon the thing,<br />
It murmured, "Please, sir, can I sing?"<br />
And then I knew its name at once&mdash;<br />
It plainly was a Cumberbunce.<br />
<br />
You are amazed that I could tell<br />
The creature's name so quickly? Well,<br />
I knew it was not a paper-doll,<br />
A pencil or a parasol,<br />
A tennis-racket or a cheese,<br />
And, as it was not one of these,<br />
And I am not a perfect dunce&mdash;<br />
It had to be a Cumberbunce!<br />
<br />
With pleading voice and tearful eye<br />
It seemed as though about to cry.<br />
It looked so pitiful and sad<br />
It made me feel extremely bad.<br />
My heart was softened to the thing<br />
That asked me if it, please, could sing.<br />
Its little hand I longed to shake,<br />
But, oh, it had no hand to take!<br />
I bent and drew the creature near,<br />
And whispered in its pale blue ear,<br />
"What! Sing, my Cumberbunce? You can!<br />
Sing on, sing loudly, little man!"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846">[Pg&nbsp;846]</a></span>

<br />
The Cumberbunce, without ado,<br />
Gazed sadly on the ocean blue,<br />
And, lifting up its little head,<br />
In tones of awful longing, said:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Oh, I would sing of mackerel skies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And why the sea is wet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of jelly-fish and conger-eels,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And things that I forget.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And I would hum a plaintive tune</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of why the waves are hot</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As water boiling on a stove,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Excepting that they're not!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"And I would sing of hooks and eyes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And why the sea is slant,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And gayly tips the little ships,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Excepting that I can't!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I never sang a single song,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I never hummed a note.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There is in me no melody,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">No music in my throat.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"So that is why I do not sing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of sharks, or whales, or anything!"</span><br />
<br />
I looked in innocent surprise,<br />
My wonder showing in my eyes,<br />
"Then why, O, Cumberbunce," I cried,<br />
"Did you come walking at my side<br />
And ask me if you, please, might sing,<br />
When you could not warble anything?"<br />
<br />
"I did not ask permission, sir,<br />
I really did not, I aver.<br />
You, sir, misunderstood me, quite.<br />
I did not ask you if I <i>might</i>.<br />
Had you correctly understood,<br />
You'd know I asked you if I <i>could</i>.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_847" id="Page_847">[Pg&nbsp;847]</a></span>

<br />
So, as I cannot sing a song,<br />
Your answer, it is plain, was wrong.<br />
The fact I could not sing I knew,<br />
But wanted your opinion, too."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A voice came softly o'er the lea.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Farewell! my mate is calling me!"</span><br />
<br />
I saw the creature disappear,<br />
Its voice, in parting, smote my ear&mdash;<br />
"I thought all people understood<br />
The difference 'twixt 'might' and 'could'!"<br />

<h3>A TRAGIC STORY</h3>

There lived a sage in days of yore,<br />
And he a handsome pigtail wore;<br />
But wondered much and sorrowed more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because it hung behind him.</span><br />
<br />
He mused upon this curious case,<br />
And swore he'd change the pigtail's place,<br />
And have it hanging at his face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not dangling there behind him.</span><br />
<br />
Says he, "The mystery I've found,&mdash;<br />
I'll turn me round,"&mdash;he turned him round;<br />

<br />
Then round and round, and out and in,<br />
All day the puzzled sage did spin;<br />
In vain&mdash;it mattered not a pin,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pigtail hung behind him.</span><br />
<br />
And right and left, and round about,<br />
And up and down, and in and out,<br />
He turned; but still the pigtail stout<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hung steadily behind him.</span><br />

Oh that my soul a marrow-bone might seize!<br />
For the old egg of my desire is broken,<br />
Spilled is the pearly white and spilled the yolk, and<br />
As the mild melancholy contents grease<br />
My path the shorn lamb baas like bumblebees.<br />
Time's trashy purse is as a taken token<br />
Or like a thrilling recitation, spoken<br />
By mournful mouths filled full of mirth and cheese.<br />
<br />
And yet, why should I clasp the earthful urn?<br />
Or find the frittered fig that felt the fast?<br />
Or choose to chase the cheese around the churn?<br />
Or swallow any pill from out the past?<br />
Ah, no Love, not while your hot kisses burn<br />
Like a potato riding on the blast.<br />

<h3>THE JIM-JAM KING OF THE JOU-JOUS</h3>

<h4>AN ARABIAN LEGEND</h4>
<p class='center'>Translated from the Arabic</p>

<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>

<p>
Far off in the waste of desert sand,<br />
The Jim-jam rules in the Jou-jou land:<br />
He sits on a throne of red-hot rocks,<br />
And moccasin snakes are his curling locks;<br />
And the Jou-jous have the conniption fits<br />
In the far-off land where the Jim-jam sits&mdash;<br />
If things are now as things were then.<br />
Allah il Allah! Oo-aye! Amen!<br />
<br />
The country's so dry in Jou-jou land<br />
You could wet it down with Sahara sand,<br />
And over its boundaries the air<br />
Is hotter than 'tis&mdash;no matter where:<br />
A camel drops down completely tanned<br />
When he crosses the line in Jou-jou land&mdash;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_852" id="Page_852">[Pg&nbsp;852]</a></span>

If things are now as things were then.<br />
Allah il Allah! Oo-aye! Amen!<br />
<br />
A traveller once got stuck in the sand<br />
On the fiery edge of Jou-jou land;<br />
The Jou-jous they confiscated him,<br />
And the Jim-jam tore him limb from limb;<br />
But, dying, he said: "If eaten I am,<br />
I'll disagree with this Dam-jim-jam!<br />
He'll think his stomach's a Hoodoo's den!"<br />
Allah il Allah! Oo-aye! Amen!<br />
<br />
Then the Jim-jam felt so bad inside,<br />
It just about humbled his royal pride.<br />
He decided to physic himself with sand,<br />
And throw up his job in the Jou-jou land.<br />
He descended his throne of red-hot rocks,<br />
And hired a barber to cut his locks:<br />
The barber died of the got-'em-again.<br />
Allah il Allah! Oo-aye! Amen!<br />
<br />
And now let every good Mussulman<br />
Get all the good from this tale he can.<br />
If you wander off on a Jamboree,<br />
Across the stretch of the desert sea,<br />
Look out that right at the height of your booze<br />
You don't get caught by the Jou-jou-jous!<br />
You may, for the Jim-jam's at it again.<br />
Allah il Allah! Oo-aye! Amen!<br />

<h3>THE ROLLICKING MASTODON</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
A rollicking Mastodon lived in Spain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the trunk of a Tranquil Tree.</span><br />
His face was plain, but his jocular vein<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was a burst of the wildest glee.</span><br />
His voice was strong and his laugh so long<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_854" id="Page_854">[Pg&nbsp;854]</a></span>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That people came many a mile,</span><br />
And offered to pay a guinea a day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the fractional part of a smile.</span><br />
<br />
The Rollicking Mastodon's laugh was wide&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Indeed, 'twas a matter of family pride;</span><br />
And oh! so proud of his jocular vein<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was the Rollicking Mastodon over in Spain.</span><br />
<br />
The Rollicking Mastodon said one day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I feel that I need some air,</span><br />
For a little ozone's a tonic for bones,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As well as a gloss for the hair."</span><br />
So he skipped along and warbled a song<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In his own triumphulant way.</span><br />
His smile was bright and his skip was light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he chirruped his roundelay.</span><br />
<br />
The Rollicking Mastodon tripped along,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sang what Mastodons call a song;</span><br />
But every note of it seemed to pain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Rollicking Mastodon over in Spain.</span><br />
<br />
A Little Peetookle came over the hill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dressed up in a bollitant coat;</span><br />
And he said, "You need some harroway seed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a little advice for your throat."</span><br />
The Mastodon smiled and said, "My child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's a chance for your taste to grow.</span><br />
If you polish your mind, you'll certainly find<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How little, how little you know."</span><br />
<br />
The Little Peetookle, his teeth he ground<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the Mastodon's singular sense of sound;</span><br />
For he felt it a sort of a musical stain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the Rollicking Mastodon over in Spain.</span><br />
<br />
"Alas! and alas! has it come to this pass?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said the Little Peetookle. "Dear me!</span><br />
It certainly seems your horrible screams<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Intended for music must be!"</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_855" id="Page_855">[Pg&nbsp;855]</a></span>

The Mastodon stopped, his ditty he dropped,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And murmured, "Good morning, my dear!</span><br />
I never will sing to a sensitive thing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That shatters a song with a sneer!"</span><br />
<br />
The Rollicking Mastodon bade him "adieu."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of course 'twas a sensible thing to do;</span><br />
For Little Peetookle is spared the strain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the Rollicking Mastodon over in Spain.</span><br />

<p>
They went to sea in a sieve, they did;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a sieve they went to sea:</span><br />
In spite of all their friends could say,<br />
On a winter's morn, on a stormy day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a sieve they went to sea.</span><br />
And when the sieve turned round and round,<br />
And every one cried, "You'll all be drowned!"<br />
They called aloud, "Our sieve ain't big;<br />
But we don't care a button, we don't care a fig:<br />

<p class='h_5'>II</p>
<p>
They sailed away in a sieve, they did,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a sieve they sailed so fast,</span><br />
With only a beautiful pea-green veil<br />
Tied with a ribbon by way of a sail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To a small tobacco-pipe mast.</span><br />
And every one said who saw them go,<br />
"Oh! won't they soon be upset, you know?<br />
For the sky is dark and the voyage is long,<br />
And, happen what may, it's extremely wrong<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a sieve to sail so fast."</span><br />

So, to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet<br />
In a pinky paper all folded neat;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they fastened it down with a pin.</span><br />
And they passed the night in a crockery-jar;<br />
And each of them said, "How wise we are!<br />
Though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long,<br />
Yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While round in our sieve we spin."</span><br />

And all night long they sailed away;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when the sun went down,</span><br />
They whistled and warbled a moony song<br />
To the echoing sound of a coppery gong,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the shade of the mountains brown.</span><br />
"O Timballoo! How happy we are<br />
When we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar!<br />
And all night long, in the moonlight pale,<br />
We sail away with a pea-green sail<br />

<p class='h_5'>V</p>
<p>
They sailed to the Western Sea, they did,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To a land all covered with trees;</span><br />
And they bought an owl and a useful cart,<br />
And a pound of rice, and a cranberry-tart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a hive of silvery bees;</span><br />
And they bought a pig, and some green jackdaws,<br />
And a lovely monkey with lollipop paws,<br />
And forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And no end of Stilton cheese.</span><br />

And in twenty years they all came back,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In twenty years or more;</span><br />

For they've been to the Lakes, and the Torrible Zone,<br />

And they drank their health, and gave them a feast&mdash;<br />
Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast;<br />

<h3>THE POBBLE WHO HAS NO TOES</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
The Pobble who has no toes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had once as many as we;</span><br />
When they said, "Some day you may lose them all,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He replied, "Fish fiddle de-dee!"</span><br />
And his Aunt Jobiska made him drink<br />
Lavender water tinged with pink;<br />
For she said, "The World in general knows<br />
There's nothing so good for a Pobble's toes!"<br />
<br />
The Pobble who has no toes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swam across the Bristol Channel;</span><br />
But before he set out he wrapped his nose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a piece of scarlet flannel.</span><br />
For his Aunt Jobiska said, "No harm<br />
Can came to his toes if his nose is warm;<br />
And it's perfectly known that a Pobble's toes<br />
Are safe&mdash;provided he minds his nose."<br />
<br />
The Pobble swam fast and well,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when boats or ships came near him,</span><br />
He tinkledy-binkledy-winkled a bell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So that all the world could hear him.</span><br />
And all the Sailors and Admirals cried,<br />
When they saw him nearing the farther side,<br />
"He has gone to fish for his Aunt Jobiska's<br />
Runcible Cat with crimson whiskers!"<br />
<br />
But before he touched the shore&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The shore of the Bristol Channel,</span><br />
A sea-green Porpoise carried away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His wrapper of scarlet flannel.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_866" id="Page_866">[Pg&nbsp;866]</a></span>

And when he came to observe his feet,<br />
Formerly garnished with toes so neat,<br />
His face at once became forlorn<br />
On perceiving that all his toes were gone!<br />
<br />
And nobody ever knew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From that dark day to the present,</span><br />
Whoso had taken the Pobble's toes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a manner so far from pleasant.</span><br />
Whether the shrimps or crawfish gray,<br />
Or crafty mermaids stole them away,<br />
Nobody knew; and nobody knows<br />
How the Pobble was robbed of his twice five toes!<br />
<br />
The Pobble who has no toes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was placed in a friendly Bark,</span><br />
And they rowed him back and carried him up<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To his Aunt Jobiska's Park.</span><br />
And she made him a feast at his earnest wish,<br />
Of eggs and buttercups fried with fish;<br />
And she said, "It's a fact the whole world knows,<br />
That Pobbles are happier without their toes."<br />

<h3>THE NEW VESTMENTS</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
There lived an old man in the kingdom of Tess,<br />
Who invented a purely original dress;<br />
And when it was perfectly made and complete,<br />
He opened the door and walked into the street.<br />
<br />
By way of a hat he'd a loaf of Brown Bread,<br />
In the middle of which he inserted his head;<br />
His Shirt was made up of no end of dead Mice,<br />
The warmth of whose skins was quite fluffy and nice;<br />
His Drawers were of Rabbit-skins, so were his Shoes,<br />
His Stockings were skins, but it is not known whose;<br />
His Waistcoat and Trowsers were made of Pork Chops;<br />
His Buttons were Jujubes and Chocolate Drops.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_867" id="Page_867">[Pg&nbsp;867]</a></span>

<br />
His Coat was all Pancakes with Jam for a border,<br />
And a girdle of Biscuits to keep it in order.<br />
And he wore over all, as a screen from bad weather,<br />
A Cloak of green Cabbage leaves, stitched all together.<br />
<br />
He had walked a short way, when he heard a great noise<br />
Of all sorts of Beasticles, Birdlings and Boys;<br />
And from every long street and dark lane in the town<br />
Beasts, Birdies and Boys in a tumult rushed down.<br />
Two Cows and a Calf ate his Cabbage leaf Cloak;<br />
Four Apes seized his girdle which vanished like smoke;<br />
Three Kids ate up half of his Pancaky Coat,<br />
And the tails were devoured by an ancient He Goat.<br />
An army of Dogs in a twinkling tore <i>up</i> his<br />
Pork Waistcoat and Trowsers to give to their Puppies;<br />
And while they were growling and mumbling the Chops<br />
Ten Boys prigged the Jujubes and Chocolate Drops.<br />
He tried to run back to his house, but in vain,<br />
For scores of fat Pigs came again and again;<br />
They rushed out of stables and hovels and doors,<br />
They tore off his Stockings, his Shoes and his Drawers.<br />
And now from the housetops with screechings descend<br />
Striped, spotted, white, black and grey Cats without end;<br />
They jumped on his shoulders and knocked off his hat,<br />
When Crows, Ducks and Hens made a mincemeat of that.<br />
They speedily flew at his sleeves in a trice<br />
And utterly tore up his Shirt of dead Mice;<br />
They swallowed the last of his Shirt with a squall,&mdash;<br />
Whereon he ran home with no clothes on at all.<br />
And he said to himself as he bolted the door,<br />
"I will not wear a similar dress any more,<br />
Any more, any more, any more, nevermore!"<br />

<h3>THE TWO OLD BACHELORS</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p class='poem'>Two old Bachelors were living in one house;</p>
<p class='poem'>One caught a Muffin, the other caught a Mouse.</p>
<p class='poem'>Said he who caught the Muffin to him who caught the Mouse,</p>
<p class='poem'>"This happens just in time, for we've nothing in the house,</p>
<p class='poem'>Save a tiny slice of lemon and a teaspoonful of honey,</p>
<p class='poem'>And what to do for dinner,&mdash;since we haven't any money?</p>
<p class='poem'>And what can we expect if we haven't any dinner</p>
<p class='poem'>But to lose our teeth and eyelashes and keep on growing thinner?"</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>Said he who caught the Mouse to him who caught the Muffin,</p>
<p class='poem'>"We might cook this little Mouse if we only had some Stuffin'!</p>
<p class='poem'>If we had but Sage and Onions we could do extremely well,</p>
<p class='poem'>But how to get that Stuffin' it is difficult to tell!"</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>And then those two old Bachelors ran quickly to the town</p>
<p class='poem'>And asked for Sage and Onions as they wandered up and down;</p>
<p class='poem'>They borrowed two large Onions, but no Sage was to be found</p>
<p class='poem'>In the Shops or in the Market or in all the Gardens round.</p>
<p class='poem'></p>
<p class='poem'>But some one said, "A hill there is, a little to the north,</p>
<p class='poem'>And to its purpledicular top a narrow way leads forth;</p>
<p class='poem'>And there among the rugged rocks abides an ancient Sage,&mdash;</p>
<p class='poem'>An earnest Man, who reads all day a most perplexing page.</p>
<p class='poem'>Climb up and seize him by the toes,&mdash;all studious as he sits,&mdash;</p>
<p class='poem'>And pull him down, and chop him into endless little bits!</p>
<p class='poem'>Then mix him with your Onion (cut up likewise into scraps),</p>
<p class='poem'>And your Stuffin' will be ready, and very good&mdash;perhaps."</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>And then those two old Bachelors, without loss of time,</p>
<p class='poem'>The nearly purpledicular crags at once began to climb;</p>
<p class='poem'>And at the top among the rocks, all seated in a nook,</p>
<p class='poem'>They saw that Sage a-reading of a most enormous book.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_869" id="Page_869">[Pg&nbsp;869]</a></span>

<p class='poem'>"You earnest Sage!" aloud they cried, "your book you've read enough in!</p>
<p class='poem'>We wish to chop you into bits and mix you into Stuffin'!"</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>But that old Sage looked calmly up, and with his awful book</p>
<p class='poem'>At those two Bachelors' bald heads a certain aim he took;</p>
<p class='poem'>And over crag and precipice they rolled promiscuous down,&mdash;</p>
<p class='poem'>At once they rolled, and never stopped in lane or field or town;</p>
<p class='poem'>And when they reached their house, they found (besides their want of Stuffin')</p>
<p class='poem'>The Mouse had fled&mdash;and previously had eaten up the Muffin.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>They left their home in silence by the once convivial door;</p>

<h3>WAYS AND MEANS</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
I'll tell thee everything I can;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's little to relate.</span><br />
I saw an aged aged man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A-sitting on a gate.</span><br />
"Who are you, aged man?" I said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And how is it you live?"</span><br />
His answer trickled through my head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like water through a sieve.</span><br />
<br />
He said, "I look for butterflies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sleep among the wheat:</span><br />
I make them into mutton-pies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sell them in the street.</span><br />
I sell them unto men," he said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Who sail on stormy seas;</span><br />
And that's the way I get my bread&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A trifle, if you please."</span><br />
<br />
But I was thinking of a plan<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To dye one's whiskers green,</span><br />
And always use so large a fan<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That they could not be seen.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_871" id="Page_871">[Pg&nbsp;871]</a></span>

So, having no reply to give<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To what the old man said,</span><br />
I cried, "Come, tell me how you live!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thumped him on the head.</span><br />
<br />
His accents mild took up the tale;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He said, "I go my ways</span><br />
And when I find a mountain-rill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I set it in a blaze;</span><br />
And thence they make a stuff they call<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rowland's Macassar Oil&mdash;</span><br />
Yet twopence-halfpenny is all<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They give me for my toil."</span><br />
<br />
But I was thinking of a way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To feed oneself on batter,</span><br />
And so go on from day to day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Getting a little fatter.</span><br />
I shook him well from side to side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until his face was blue;</span><br />
"Come, tell me how you live," I cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And what it is you do!"</span><br />
<br />
He said, "I hunt for haddock's eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Among the heather bright,</span><br />
And work them into waistcoat-buttons<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the silent night.</span><br />
And these I do not sell for gold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or coin of silvery shine,</span><br />
But for a copper halfpenny<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And that will purchase nine.</span><br />
<br />
"I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or set limed twigs for crabs;</span><br />
I sometimes search the grassy knolls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For wheels of Hansom cabs.</span><br />
And that's the way" (he gave a wink)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"By which I get my wealth&mdash;</span><br />
And very gladly will I drink<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your Honor's noble health."</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_872" id="Page_872">[Pg&nbsp;872]</a></span>

<br />
I heard him then, for I had just<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Completed my design</span><br />
To keep the Menai Bridge from rust<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By boiling it in wine.</span><br />
I thanked him much for telling me<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And could not choose but look and laugh&mdash;</span><br />
A land where the small the great includes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the whole is less than the half!</span><br />
<br />
A land where the circles were not lines<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Round central points, as schoolmen show,</span><br />
And the parallels met whenever they chose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And went playing at touch-and-go!</span><br />
<br />
There&mdash;except that every round was square,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And save that all the squares were rounds&mdash;</span><br />
No surface had limits anywhere,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So they never could beat the bounds.</span><br />
<br />
In their gardens, fruit before blossom came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the trees diminished as they grew;</span><br />
And you never went out to walk a mile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was the mile that walked to you.</span><br />
<br />
The people there are not tall or short,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heavy or light, or stout or thin,</span><br />
And their lives begin where they should leave off,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or leave off where they should begin.</span><br />
<br />
There childhood, with naught of childish glee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Looks on the world with thoughtful brow;</span><br />
'Tis only the aged who laugh and crow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cry "We have done with it now!";</span><br />
<br />
A singular race! what lives they spent!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Got up before they went to bed!</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_885" id="Page_885">[Pg&nbsp;885]</a></span>

And never a man said what he meant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or a woman meant what she said.</span><br />
<br />
They blended colours that will not blend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All hideous contrasts voted sweet;</span><br />
In yellow and red their Quakers dress'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And considered it rather neat.</span><br />
<br />
They didn't believe in the wise and good,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said the best were worst, the wisest fools;</span><br />
And 'twas only to have their teachers taught<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That they founded national schools.</span><br />
<br />
They read in "books that are no books,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their classics&mdash;chess-boards neatly bound;</span><br />
Those their greatest authors who never wrote,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their deepest the least profound.</span><br />
<br />
Now, such were the folks of that wonder-land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A curious people, as you will own;</span><br />
But are there none of the race abroad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are no specimens elsewhere known?</span><br />
<br />
Well, I think that he whose views of life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are crooked, wrong, perverse, and odd,</span><br />
Who looks upon all with jaundiced eyes&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sees himself and believes it God,</span><br />
<br />
Who sneers at the good, and makes the ill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Curses a world he cannot mend;</span><br />
Who measures life by the rule of wrong<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And abuses its aim and end,</span><br />
<br />
The man who stays when he ought to move,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And only goes when he ought to stop&mdash;</span><br />
Is strangely like the folk in my dream,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And would flourish in Turvey Top.</span><br />

<p>
There was a snake that dwelt in Skye,<br />

The snake had sometimes nothing to eat,<br />

<br />
Then he'd flick his tongue and his head he'd shake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over the misty sea, oh,</span><br />
Crying, "Gooseberry pie! For goodness' sake,<br />

And if gooseberry pie was not to be had,<br />

<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">Upon the Only Cam-u-el&mdash;</span></p>
<p class='poem'>A bumpy, grumpy Quadruped of discontented mouth.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">The atmosphere was glutinous;</span></p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">The Cam-u-el was mutinous;</span></p>

<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">He made the desert hideous;</span></p>
<p class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">With strategy perfidious</span></p>
<p class='poem'>He tied his neck in curlicues, he kicked his paddy heels.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">Then quoth the gentle Sam-u-el,</span></p>

<p class='poem'>Though zealously I've shielded you from every grief and woe,</p>

Be kind to the camel! nor let word of thine<br />

And cherish the she-kangaroo with her bag,<br />

Be kind to the ostrich! for how canst thou hope<br />

Be kind to the bison! and let the jackal<br />

And coax the ichneumon to grow a new tail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And have lots of larks in its lair!</span><br />

Be kind to the bustard, that genial bird,<br />

<h3>OF BAITING THE LION</h3>

Remembering his taste for blood<br />

Persuade the brute to chew the cud<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her tail suspended from a bough;</span><br />
It thrills the lion through and through<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hear the milky creature moo.</span><br />
<br />
Having arranged this simple ruse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yourself you climb a neighboring tree;</span><br />
See to it that the spot you choose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Commands the coming tragedy;</span><br />
Take up a smallish Maxim gun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A search-light, whisky, and a bun.</span><br />
<br />
It's safer, too, to have your bike<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Standing immediately below,</span><br />
In case your piece should fail to strike,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or deal an ineffective blow;</span><br />
The Lion moves with perfect grace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But cannot go the scorcher's pace.</span><br />
<br />
Keep open ear for subtle signs;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus, when the cow profusely moans,</span><br />
That means to say, the Lion dines.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The crunching sound, of course, is bones;</span><br />
Silence resumes her ancient reign&mdash;<br />

Turn up the light and let it come<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full on his innocent repose;</span><br />
Then pour your shot between his eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And go on pouring till he dies.</span><br />

Play, even so, discretion's part;<br />

<h3>WHY DOTH A PUSSY CAT?</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Why doth a pussy cat prefer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When dozing, drowsy, on the sill,</span><br />
To purr and purr and purr and purr<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Instead of merely keeping still?</span><br />
With nodding head and folded paws,<br />
She keeps it up without a cause.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_896" id="Page_896">[Pg&nbsp;896]</a></span>

<br />
Why doth she flaunt her lofty tail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In such a stiff right-angled pose?</span><br />
If lax and limp she let it trail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twould seem more restful, Goodness knows!</span><br />
When strolling 'neath the chairs or bed,<br />
She lets it bump above her head.<br />
<br />
Why doth she suddenly refrain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From anything she's busied in</span><br />
And start to wash, with might and main,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Most any place upon her skin?</span><br />
Why doth she pick that special spot,<br />
Not seeing if it's soiled or not?<br />
<br />
Why doth she never seem to care<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To come directly when you call,</span><br />
But makes approach from here and there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or sidles half around the wall?</span><br />
Though doors are opened at her mew,<br />
You often have to push her through.<br />
<br />
Why doth she this? Why doth she that?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I seek for cause&mdash;I yearn for clews;</span><br />
The subject of the pussy cat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Doth endlessly inspire the mews.</span><br />
Why doth a pussy cat? Ah, me,<br />
I haven't got the least idee.       '.<br />

<h3>THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
The sun was shining on the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shining with all his might:</span><br />
He did his very best to make<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The billows smooth and bright&mdash;</span><br />
And this was odd, because it was<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The middle of the night.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_897" id="Page_897">[Pg&nbsp;897]</a></span>

<br />
The moon was shining sulkily,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because she thought the sun</span><br />
Had got no business to be there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">After the day was done&mdash;</span><br />
"It's very rude of him," she said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To come and spoil the fun!"</span><br />
<br />
The sea was wet as wet could be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sands were dry as dry.</span><br />
You could not see a cloud, because<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No cloud was in the sky:</span><br />
No birds were flying overhead&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There were no birds to fly.</span><br />
<br />
The Walrus and the Carpenter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were walking close at hand;</span><br />
They wept like anything to see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such quantities of sand:</span><br />
"If this were only cleared away,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They said, "it would be grand!"</span><br />
<br />
"If seven maids with seven mops<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swept it for half a year,</span><br />
Do you suppose," the Walrus said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"That they could get it clear?"</span><br />
"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shed a bitter tear.</span><br />
<br />
"O Oysters come and walk with us!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Walrus did beseech.</span><br />
"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along the briny beach:</span><br />
We cannot do with more than four,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To give a hand to each."</span><br />
<br />
The eldest Oyster looked at him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But not a word he said:</span><br />
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shook his heavy head&mdash;</span><br />
Meaning to say he did not choose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To leave the oyster-bed.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_898" id="Page_898">[Pg&nbsp;898]</a></span>

<br />
But four young Oysters hurried up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All eager for the treat:</span><br />
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their shoes were clean and neat&mdash;</span><br />
And this was odd, because, you know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They hadn't any feet.</span><br />
<br />
Four other Oysters followed them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet another four;</span><br />
And thick and fast they came at last,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And more, and more, and more&mdash;</span><br />
All hopping through the frothy waves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scrambling to the shore.</span><br />
<br />
The Walrus and the Carpenter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Walked on a mile or so,</span><br />
And then they rested on a rock,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Conveniently low:</span><br />
And all the little Oysters stood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And waited in a row.</span><br />
<br />
"The time has come," the Walrus said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To talk of many things:</span><br />
Of shoes&mdash;and ships&mdash;and sealing-wax&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of cabbages&mdash;and kings&mdash;</span><br />
And why the sea is boiling hot&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And whether pigs have wings."</span><br />
<br />
"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Before we have our chat;</span><br />
For some of us are out of breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all of us are fat!"</span><br />
"No hurry!" said the Carpenter.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They thanked him much for that.</span><br />
<br />
"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Is what we chiefly need;</span><br />
Pepper and vinegar besides<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are very good indeed&mdash;</span><br />
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We can begin to feed."</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_899" id="Page_899">[Pg&nbsp;899]</a></span>

<br />
"But not on us," the Oysters cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turning a little blue.</span><br />
"After such kindness that would be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dismal thing to do!"</span><br />
"The night is fine," the Walrus said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Do you admire the view?"</span><br />
<br />
"It was so kind of you to come,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And you are very nice!"</span><br />
The Carpenter said nothing but,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Cut us another slice.</span><br />
I wish you were not quite so deaf&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've had to ask you twice!"</span><br />
<br />
"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To play them such a trick.</span><br />
After we've brought them out so far<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made them trot so quick!"</span><br />
The Carpenter said nothing but,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The butter's spread too thick!"</span><br />
<br />
"I weep for you," the Walrus said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I deeply sympathize."</span><br />
With sobs and tears he sorted out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those of the largest size,</span><br />
Holding his pocket-handkerchief<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before his streaming eyes.</span><br />
<br />
"O Oysters," said the Carpenter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You've had a pleasant run!</span><br />
Shall we be trotting home again?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But answer came there none&mdash;</span><br />
And this was scarcely odd, because<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They'd eaten every one.</span><br />

They took some honey, and plenty of money<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wrapped up in a five-pound note.</span><br />
The Owl looked up to the stars above,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sang to a small guitar,</span><br />
"Oh, lovely Pussy, oh, Pussy, my love,<br />

Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl,<br />

Oh, let us be married; too long we have tarried:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But what shall we do for a ring?"</span><br />
They sailed away for a year and a day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the land where the bong-tree grows;</span><br />
And there in the wood a Piggy-wig stood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a ring at the end of his nose,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">His nose,</span><br />

"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling<br />

So they took it away and were married next day<br />

<h3>THE COLUBRIAD</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Close by the threshold of a door nailed fast,<br />
Three kittens sat; each kitten looked aghast.<br />
I, passing swift and inattentive by,<br />
At the three kittens cast a careless eye;<br />
Not much concerned to know what they did there;<br />
Not deeming kittens worth a poet's care.<br />
But presently, a loud and furious hiss<br />
Caused me to stop, and to exclaim, "What's this?"<br />
When lo! upon the threshold met my view,<br />
With head erect, and eyes of fiery hue,<br />
A viper long as Count de Grasse's queue.<br />
Forth from his head his forked tongue he throws,<br />
Darting it full against a kitten's nose;<br />
Who, having never seen, in field or house,<br />
The like, sat still and silent as a mouse;<br />
Only projecting, with attention due,<br />
Her whiskered face, she asked him, "Who are you?"<br />
On to the hall went I, with pace not slow,<br />
But swift as lightning, for a long Dutch hoe:<br />
With which well armed, I hastened to the spot<br />
To find the viper&mdash;but I found him not.<br />
And, turning up the leaves and shrubs around,<br />
Found only that he was not to be found;<br />
But still the kittens, sitting as before,<br />
Sat watching close the bottom of the door.<br />
"I hope," said I, "the villain I would kill<br />
Has slipped between the door and the door-sill;<br />
And if I make despatch, and follow hard,<br />
No doubt but I shall find him in the yard:"<br />
(For long ere now it should have been rehearsed,<br />
'Twas in the garden that I found him first.)<br />
E'en there I found him: there the full-grown cat<br />
His head, with velvet paw, did gently pat;<br />
As curious as the kittens erst had been<br />
To learn what this phenomenon might mean.<br />
Filled with heroic ardour at the sight,<br />
And fearing every moment he would bite,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_910" id="Page_910">[Pg&nbsp;910]</a></span>

And rob our household of our only cat<br />
That was of age to combat with a rat;<br />
With outstretched hoe I slew him at the door,<br />
And taught him never to come there no more!<br />

<h3>THE RETIRED CAT</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
A Poet's Cat, sedate and grave<br />
As poet well could wish to have,<br />
Was much addicted to inquire<br />
For nooks to which she might retire,<br />
And where, secure as mouse in chink,<br />
She might repose, or sit and think.<br />
I know not where she caught the trick;<br />
Nature perhaps herself had cast her<br />
In such a mold <span class="smcap">philosophique</span>,<br />
Or else she learned it of her master.<br />
Sometimes ascending, debonair,<br />
An apple-tree, or lofty pear,<br />
Lodged with convenience in the fork,<br />
She watched the gardener at his work;<br />
Sometimes her ease and solace sought<br />
In an old empty watering-pot,<br />
There wanting nothing, save a fan,<br />
To seem some nymph in her sedan,<br />
Appareled in exactest sort,<br />
And ready to be borne to court.<br />
<br />
But love of change it seems has place<br />
Not only in our wiser race;<br />
Cats also feel, as well as we,<br />
That passion's force, and so did she.<br />
Her climbing, she began to find,<br />
Exposed her too much to the wind,<br />
And the old utensil of tin<br />
Was cold and comfortless within:<br />
She therefore wished, instead of those,<br />
Some place of more serene repose,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_911" id="Page_911">[Pg&nbsp;911]</a></span>

Where neither cold might come, nor air<br />
Too rudely wanton in her hair,<br />
And sought it in the likeliest mode<br />
Within her master's snug abode.<br />
<br />
A drawer, it chanced, at bottom lined<br />
With linen of the softest kind,<br />
With such as merchants introduce<br />
From India, for the ladies' use;<br />
A drawer, impending o'er the rest,<br />
Half open, in the topmost chest,<br />
Of depth enough, and none to spare,<br />
Invited her to slumber there;<br />
Puss with delight beyond expression,<br />
Surveyed the scene and took possession.<br />
Recumbent at her ease, ere long,<br />
And lulled by her own humdrum song,<br />
She left the cares of life behind,<br />
And slept as she would sleep her last,<br />
When in came, housewifely inclined,<br />
The chambermaid, and shut it fast,<br />
By no malignity impelled,<br />
But all unconscious whom it held.<br />
<br />
Awakened by the shock (cried puss)<br />
"Was ever cat attended thus!<br />
The open drawer was left, I see,<br />
Merely to prove a nest for me,<br />
For soon as I was well composed,<br />
Then came the maid, and it was closed.<br />
How smooth those 'kerchiefs, and how sweet<br />
Oh what a delicate retreat!<br />
I will resign myself to rest<br />
Till Sol declining in the west,<br />
Shall call to supper, when, no doubt,<br />
Susan will come, and let me out."<br />
<br />
The evening came, the sun descended,<br />
And puss remained still unattended.<br />
The night rolled tardily away<br />
(With her indeed 'twas never day),<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_912" id="Page_912">[Pg&nbsp;912]</a></span>

The sprightly morn her course renewed,<br />
The evening gray again ensued,<br />
And puss came into mind no more<br />
Than if entombed the day before;<br />
With hunger pinched, and pinched for room,<br />
She now presaged approaching doom.<br />
Nor slept a single wink, nor purred,<br />
Conscious of jeopardy incurred.<br />
<br />
That night, by chance, the poet, watching,<br />
Heard an inexplicable scratching;<br />
His noble heart went pit-a-pat,<br />
And to himself he said&mdash;"What's that?"<br />
He drew the curtain at his side,<br />
And forth he peeped, but nothing spied.<br />
Yet, by his ear directed, guessed<br />
Something imprisoned in the chest;<br />
And, doubtful what, with prudent care<br />
Resolved it should continue there.<br />
At length a voice which well he knew,<br />
A long and melancholy mew,<br />
Saluting his poetic ears,<br />
Consoled him, and dispelled his fears;<br />
He left his bed, he trod the floor,<br />
He 'gan in haste the drawers explore,<br />
The lowest first, and without stop<br />
The next in order to the top.<br />
For 'tis a truth well known to most,<br />
That whatsoever thing is lost,<br />
We seek it, ere it come to light,<br />
In every cranny but the right.<br />
Forth skipped the cat, not now replete<br />
As erst with airy self-conceit,<br />
Nor in her own fond comprehension,<br />
A theme for all the world's attention,<br />
But modest, sober, cured of all<br />
Her notions hyperbolical,<br />
And wishing for a place of rest,<br />
Any thing rather than a chest.<br />
Then stepped the poet into bed<br />
With this reflection in his head:<br />

<p>
Oh, many have told of the monkeys of old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What a pleasant race they were,</span><br />
And it seems most true that I and you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are derived from an apish pair.</span><br />
They all had nails, and some had tails,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some&mdash;no "accounts in arrear";</span><br />
They climbed up the trees, and they scratched out the&mdash;these<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of course I will not mention here.</span><br />
<br />
They slept in a wood, or wherever they could,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For they didn't know how to make beds;</span><br />
They hadn't got huts; they dined upon nuts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which they cracked upon each other's heads.</span><br />
They hadn't much scope, for a comb, brush or soap,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or towels, or kettle or fire.</span><br />
They had no coats nor capes, for ne'er did these apes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Invent what they didn't require.</span><br />
<br />
The sharpest baboon never used fork or spoon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor made any boots for his toes,</span><br />
Nor could any thief steal a silk handker-chief,<br />

<h3>THE PIG</h3>

<h4>A COLLOQUIAL POEM</h4>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Jacob! I do not like to see thy nose<br />
Turn'd up in scornful curve at yonder pig,<br />
It would be well, my friend, if we like him,<br />
Were perfect in our kind!... And why despise<br />
The sow-born grunter?... He is obstinate,<br />
Thou answerest; ugly, and the filthiest beast<br />
That banquets upon offal.... Now I pray you<br />
Hear the pig's counsel.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Is he obstinate?</span><br />
We must not, Jacob, be deceived by words;<br />
We must not take them as unheeding hands<br />
Receive base money at the current worth<br />
But with a just suspicion try their sound,<br />
And in the even balance weight them well<br />
See now to what this obstinacy comes:<br />
A poor, mistreated, democratic beast,<br />
He knows that his unmerciful drivers seek<br />
Their profit, and not his. He hath not learned<br />
That pigs were made for man,... born to be brawn'd<br />
And baconized: that he must please to give<br />
Just what his gracious masters please to take;<br />
Perhaps his tusks, the weapons Nature gave<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_915" id="Page_915">[Pg&nbsp;915]</a></span>

For self-defense, the general privilege;<br />
Perhaps,... hark, Jacob! dost thou hear that horn?<br />
Woe to the young posterity of Pork!<br />
Their enemy is at hand.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Again. Thou say'st</span><br />
The pig is ugly. Jacob, look at him!<br />
Those eyes have taught the lover flattery.<br />
His face,... nay, Jacob! Jacob! were it fair<br />
To judge a lady in her dishabille?<br />
Fancy it dressed, and with saltpeter rouged.<br />
Behold his tail, my friend; with curls like that<br />
The wanton hop marries her stately spouse:<br />
So crisp in beauty Amoretta's hair<br />
Rings round her lover's soul the chains of love.<br />
And what is beauty, but the aptitude<br />
Of parts harmonious? Give thy fancy scope,<br />
And thou wilt find that no imagined change<br />
Can beautify this beast. Place at his end<br />
The starry glories of the peacock's pride,<br />
Give him the swan's white breast; for his horn-hoofs<br />
Shape such a foot and ankle as the waves<br />
Crowded in eager rivalry to kiss<br />
When Venus from the enamor'd sea arose;...<br />
Jacob, thou canst but make a monster of him!<br />
An alteration man could think, would mar<br />
His pig-perfection.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 14em;">The last charge,... he lives</span><br />
A dirty life. Here I could shelter him<br />
With noble and right-reverend precedents.<br />
And show by sanction of authority<br />
That 'tis a very honorable thing<br />
To thrive by dirty ways. But let me rest<br />
On better ground the unanswerable defense.<br />
The pig is a philosopher, who knows<br />
No prejudice. Dirt?... Jacob, what is dirt?<br />
If matter,... why the delicate dish that tempts<br />
An o'ergorged epicure to the last morsel<br />
That stuffs him to the throat-gates, is no more.<br />
If matter be not, but as sages say,<br />
Spirit is all, and all things visible<br />
Are one, the infinitely modified,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_916" id="Page_916">[Pg&nbsp;916]</a></span>

Think, Jacob, what that pig is, and the mire<br />
Wherein he stands knee-deep!<br />

<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And there! the breeze</span><br />
Pleads with me, and has won thee to a smile<br />
That speaks conviction. O'er yon blossom'd field<br />
Of beans it came, and thoughts of bacon rise.<br />

So soft, so liquid, that a spell<br />

Years, childhood passed, youth fled away,<br />

But, woe is me! on earthly ground<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some ill with every blessing dwells;</span><br />
And soon to my dismay I found<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That this applies to young Gazelles.</span><br />
<br />
When free allowed to roam indoors,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mischief that he did was great;</span><br />
The walls, the furniture, the floors,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He made in a terrific state.</span><br />
<br />
He nibbled at the table-cloth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And trod the carpet into holes,</span><br />
And in his gambols, nothing loth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kicked over scuttles full of coals.</span><br />
<br />
To view his image in the glass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He reared upon his hinder legs;</span><br />
And thus one morn I found, alas!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Two porcelain vases smashed like eggs.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_920" id="Page_920">[Pg&nbsp;920]</a></span>

<br />
Whatever did his fancy catch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By way of food, he would not wait</span><br />
To be invited, but would snatch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It from one's table, hand, or plate.</span><br />
<br />
He riled the dog, annoyed the cat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scared the goldfish into fits;</span><br />
He butted through my newest hat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tore my manuscript to bits.</span><br />
<br />
'Twas strange, so light his hooflets weighed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His limbs as slender as a hare's,</span><br />
The noise my little Selim made<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In trotting up and down the stairs.</span><br />
<br />
To tie him up I thought was wise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But loss of freedom gave him pain;</span><br />
I could not stand those pleading eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so I let him go again.</span><br />
<br />
How sweet to see him skip and prance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the gravel or the lawn;</span><br />
More light in step than fairies' dance,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More graceful than an English fawn.</span><br />
<br />
But then he spoilt the garden so,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Trod down the beds, raked up the seeds,</span><br />
And ate the plants&mdash;nor did he show<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The least compunction for his deeds.</span><br />
<br />
He trespassed on the neighbors' ground,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And broke two costly melon frames,</span><br />
With other damages&mdash;a pound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To pay, resulted from his games.</span><br />
<br />
In short, the mischief was immense<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That from his gamesome pranks befel,</span><br />
And, truly, in a double sense,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He proved a <i>very</i> "dear Gazelle."</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_921" id="Page_921">[Pg&nbsp;921]</a></span>

<br />
At length I sighed&mdash;"Ah, ever thus<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Doth disappointment mock each hope;</span><br />
But 'tis in vain to make a fuss;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You'll have to go, my antelope."</span><br />
<br />
The chance I wished for did occur;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A lady going to the East</span><br />
Was willing; so I gave to her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That little antelopian beast.</span><br />
<br />
I said, "This antler'd desert child<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Turkish palaces may roam,</span><br />
But he is much too free and wild<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To keep in any English home."</span><br />
<br />
Yes, tho' I gave him up with tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Experience had broke the spell,</span><br />
And if I live a thousand years,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll never have a young Gazelle.</span><br />

<h3>THE BALLAD OF THE EMEU</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
O say, have you seen at the Willows so green&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So charming and rurally true&mdash;</span><br />
A Singular bird; with a manner absurd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which they call the Australian Emeu?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Have you?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ever seen this Australian Emeu?</span><br />
<br />
It trots all around with its head on the ground,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or erects it quite out of your view;</span><br />
And the ladies all cry, when its figure they spy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O, what a sweet pretty Emeu!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Oh! do</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just look at that lovely Emeu!"</span><br />
<br />
One day to this spot, when the weather was hot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came Matilda Hortense Fortescue;</span><br />
And beside her there came a youth of high name&mdash;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_922" id="Page_922">[Pg&nbsp;922]</a></span>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Augustus Florell Montague:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">The two</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Both loved that wild foreign Emeu.</span><br />
<br />
With two loaves of bread then they fed it, instead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the flesh of the white cockatoo,</span><br />
Which once was its food in that wild neighbourhood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where ranges the sweet kangaroo</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">That, too,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is game for the famous Emeu!</span><br />
<br />
Old saws and gimlets but its appetite whet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the world famous bark of Peru;</span><br />
There's nothing so hard that the bird will discard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And nothing its taste will eschew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">That you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can give that long-legged Emeu!</span><br />
<br />
The time slipped away in this innocent play,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When up jumped the bold Montague:</span><br />
"Where's that specimen pin that I gaily did win<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In raffle, and gave unto you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Fortescue?"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No word spoke the guilty Emeu!</span><br />
<br />
"Quick! tell me his name whom thou gavest that same,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere these hands in thy blood I imbrue!"</span><br />
"Nay, dearest," she cried as she clung to his side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I'm innocent as that Emeu!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">"Adieu!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He replied, "Miss M. H. Fortescue!"</span><br />
<br />
Down she dropped at his feet, all as white as a sheet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As wildly he fled from her view;</span><br />
He thought 'twas her sin&mdash;for he knew not the pin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had been gobbled up by the Emeu;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">All through</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I'm innocent as that Emeu!"</span><br />

<h3>THE TURTLE AND FLAMINGO</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
A lively young turtle lived down by the banks<br />
Of a dark rolling stream called the Jingo;<br />
And one summer day, as he went out to play,<br />
Fell in love with a charming flamingo&mdash;<br />
An enormously genteel flamingo!<br />
An expansively crimson flamingo!<br />
A beautiful, bouncing flamingo!<br />
<br />
Spake the turtle, in tones like a delicate wheeze:<br />
"To the water I've oft seen you in go,<br />
And your form has impressed itself deep on my shell,<br />
You perfectly modelled flamingo!<br />
You tremendously A-1 flamingo!<br />
You in-ex-press-<i>i</i>-ble flamingo!<br />
<br />
"To be sure, I'm a turtle, and you are a belle,<br />
And my language is not your fine lingo;<br />
But smile on me, tall one, and be my bright flame,<br />
You miraculous, wondrous flamingo!<br />
You blazingly beauteous flamingo!<br />
You turtle-absorbing flamingo!<br />
You inflammably gorgeous flamingo!"<br />
<br />
Then the proud bird blushed redder than ever before,<br />
And that was quite un-nec-es-<i>sa</i>-ry,<br />
And she stood on one leg and looked out of one eye,<br />
The position of things for to vary,&mdash;<br />
This aquatical, musing flamingo!<br />
This dreamy, uncertain flamingo!<br />
This embarrasing, harassing flamingo!<br />
<br />
Then she cried to the quadruped, greatly amazed:<br />
"Why your passion toward <i>me</i> do you hurtle?<br />
I'm an ornithological wonder of grace,<br />
And you're an illogical turtle,&mdash;<br />
A waddling, impossible turtle!<br />
A low-minded, grass-eating turtle!<br />
A highly improbable turtle!"<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_924" id="Page_924">[Pg&nbsp;924]</a></span>

<br />
Then the turtle sneaked off with his nose to the ground<br />
And never more looked at the lasses;<br />
And falling asleep, while indulging his grief,<br />
Was gobbled up whole by Agassiz,&mdash;<br />
The peripatetic Agassiz!<br />
The turtle-dissecting Agassiz!<br />
The illustrious, industrious Agassiz!<br />
<br />
Go with me to Cambridge some cool, pleasant day,<br />
And the skeleton lover I'll show you;<br />
He's in a hard case, but he'll look in your face,<br />
Pretending (the rogue!) he don't know you!<br />
Oh, the deeply deceptive young turtle!<br />
The double-faced, glassy-cased turtle!<br />
The <i>green</i> but a very <i>mock</i> turtle!<br />

Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sailed off in a wooden shoe,&mdash;</span><br />
Sailed on a river of misty light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into a sea of dew.</span><br />
"Where are you going, and what do you wish?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The old moon asked the three.</span><br />
"We have come to fish for the herring-fish<br />

And the wind that sped them all night long<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ruffled the waves of dew;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 11em;">It grew.</span><br />
<br />
One day, walking the orchard through,<br />
That little peach dawned on the view<br />
Of Johnny Jones and his sister Sue&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Those two.</span><br />
<br />
Up at the peach a club they threw:<br />
Down from the limb on which it grew,<br />
Fell the little peach of emerald hue&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Too true!</span><br />
<br />
John took a bite, and Sue took a chew,<br />
And then the trouble began to brew,&mdash;<br />
Trouble the doctor couldn't subdue,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Paregoric too.</span><br />
<br />
Under the turf where the daisies grew,<br />
They planted John and his sister Sue;<br />
And their little souls to the angels flew&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Boo-hoo!</span><br />
<br />
But what of the peach of emerald hue,<br />
Warmed by the sun, and wet by the dew?<br />
Ah, well! its mission on earth is through&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Adieu!</span><br />

<h3>COUNSEL TO THOSE THAT EAT</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
With chocolate-cream that you buy in the cake<br />
Large mouthfuls and hurry are quite a mistake.<br />
<br />
Wise persons prolong it as long as they can<br />
But putting in practice this excellent plan.<br />
<br />
The cream from the chocolate lining they dig<br />
With a Runaway match or a clean little twig.<br />
<br />
Many hundreds,&mdash;nay, thousands&mdash;of scoopings they make<br />
Before they've exhausted a twopenny cake.<br />
<br />
With ices 'tis equally wrongful to haste;<br />
You ought to go slowly and dwell on each taste.<br />
<br />
Large mouthfuls are painful, as well as unwise,<br />
For they lead to an ache at the back of the eyes.<br />
<br />
And the delicate sip is e'en better, one finds,<br />
If the ice is a mixture of different kinds.<br />

<h3>A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br />
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br />
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br />
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;<br />
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br />
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;<br />
And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,<br />
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,<br />
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br />
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_936" id="Page_936">[Pg&nbsp;936]</a></span>

Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br />
Tore open the shutters, and threw up the sash.<br />
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br />
Gave a luster of mid-day to objects below,<br />
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br />
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,<br />
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br />
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.<br />
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br />
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;<br />
"Now, <i>Dasher</i>! now, <i>Dancer</i>! now, <i>Prancer</i> and <i>Vixen</i>!<br />
On, <i>Comet</i>! on, <i>Cupid</i>! on, <i>Dunder</i> and <i>Blitzen</i>!<br />
To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!<br />
Now, dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"<br />
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br />
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;<br />
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew,<br />
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas, too.<br />
And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br />
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br />
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br />
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.<br />
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br />
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;<br />
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br />
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.<br />
His eyes&mdash;how they twinkled!&mdash;his dimples how merry!<br />
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br />
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br />
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;<br />
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br />
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;<br />
He had a broad face and a round little belly,<br />
That shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.<br />
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br />
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;<br />
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br />
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;<br />
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br />
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_937" id="Page_937">[Pg&nbsp;937]</a></span>

And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br />
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;<br />
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br />
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;<br />
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,<br />
"<i>Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night</i>!"<br />

<h3>A NURSERY LEGEND</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p class='poem'>Oh! listen, little children, to a proper little song</p>
<p class='poem'>Of a naughty little urchin who was always doing wrong:</p>
<p class='poem'>He disobey'd his mammy, and he disobey'd his dad,</p>
<p class='poem'>And he disobey'd his uncle, which was very near as bad.</p>
<p class='poem'>He wouldn't learn to cipher, and he wouldn't learn to write,</p>
<p class='poem'>But he <i>would</i> tear up his copy-books to fabricate a kite;</p>
<p class='poem'>And he used his slate and pencil in so barbarous a way,</p>
<p class='poem'>That the grinders of his governess got looser ev'ry day.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>At last he grew so obstinate that no one could contrive</p>
<p class='poem'>To cure him of a theory that two and two made five</p>
<p class='poem'>And, when they taught him how to spell, he show'd his wicked whims</p>
<p class='poem'>By mutilating Pinnock and mislaying Watts's Hymns.</p>
<p class='poem'>Instead of all such pretty books, (which <i>must</i> improve the mind,)</p>
<p class='poem'>He cultivated volumes of a most improper kind;</p>
<p class='poem'>Directories and almanacks he studied on the sly,</p>
<p class='poem'>And gloated over Bradshaw's Guide when nobody was by.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>From such a course of reading you can easily divine</p>
<p class='poem'>The condition of his morals at the age of eight or nine.</p>
<p class='poem'>His tone of conversation kept becoming worse and worse,</p>
<p class='poem'>Till it scandalised his governess and horrified his nurse.</p>
<p class='poem'>He quoted bits of Bradshaw that were quite unfit to hear,</p>
<p class='poem'>And recited from the Almanack, no matter who was near:</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_938" id="Page_938">[Pg&nbsp;938]</a></span>

<p class='poem'>He talked of Reigate Junction and of trains both up and down,</p>
<p class='poem'>And referr'd to men who call'd themselves Jones, Robinson, and Brown.</p>

<p class='poem' style='margin-top: 1em;'>But when this naughty boy grew up he found the proverb true,</p>
<p class='poem'>That Fate one day makes people pay for all the wrong they do.</p>
<p class='poem'>He was cheated out of money by a man whose name was Brown,</p>
<p class='poem'>And got crippled in a railway smash while coming up to town.</p>
<p class='poem'>So, little boys and little girls, take warning while you can,</p>
<p class='poem'>And profit by the history of this unhappy man.</p>
<p class='poem'>Read Dr. Watts and Pinnock, dears; and when you learn to spell,</p>
<p class='poem'>Shun Railway Guides, Directories, and Almanacks as well!</p>

<h3>A LITTLE GOOSE</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
The chill November day was done,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The working world home faring;</span><br />
The wind came roaring through the streets<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And set the gas-lights flaring;</span><br />
And hopelessly and aimlessly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The scared old leaves were flying;</span><br />
When, mingled with the sighing wind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I heard a small voice crying.</span><br />
<br />
And shivering on the corner stood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A child of four, or over;</span><br />
No cloak or hat her small, soft arms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wind blown curls to cover.</span><br />
Her dimpled face was stained with tears;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her round blue eyes ran over;</span><br />
She cherished in her wee, cold hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A bunch of faded clover.</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_939" id="Page_939">[Pg&nbsp;939]</a></span>

<br />
And one hand round her treasure while<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She slipped in mine the other:</span><br />
Half scared, half confidential, said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Oh! please, I want my mother!"</span><br />
"Tell me your street and number, pet:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Don't cry, I'll take you to it."</span><br />
Sobbing she answered, "I forget:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The organ made me do it.</span><br />
<br />
"He came and played at Milly's steps,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The monkey took the money;</span><br />
And so I followed down the street,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The monkey was so funny.</span><br />
I've walked about a hundred hours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From one street to another:</span><br />
The monkey's gone, I've spoiled my flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! please, I want my mother."</span><br />
<br />
"But what's your mother's name? and what<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The street? Now think a minute."</span><br />
"My mother's name is mamma dear&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The street&mdash;I can't begin it."</span><br />
"But what is strange about the house,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or new&mdash;not like the others?"</span><br />
"I guess you mean my trundle-bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mine and my little brother's.</span><br />
<br />
"Oh dear! I ought to be at home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To help him say his prayers,&mdash;</span><br />
He's such a baby he forgets;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we are both such players;&mdash;</span><br />
And there's a bar to keep us both<br />

For Harry rolls when he's asleep:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh dear! I want my mother."</span><br />
<br />
The sky grew stormy; people passed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All muffled, homeward faring:</span><br />
"You'll have to spend the night with me,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I said at last, despairing,</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_940" id="Page_940">[Pg&nbsp;940]</a></span>

I tied a kerchief round her neck&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What ribbon's this, my blossom?"</span><br />
"Why don't you know!" she smiling, said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drew it from her bosom.</span><br />
<br />
A card with number, street, and name;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My eyes astonished met it;</span><br />
"For," said the little one, "you see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I might sometimes forget it:</span><br />
And so I wear a little thing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That tells you all about it;</span><br />

(That dog will bite him if he pulls its tail!)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou human humming-bee, extracting honey</span><br />
From every blossom in the world that blows,<br />

Toss the light ball&mdash;bestride the stick&mdash;<br />

With fancies, buoyant as the thistle-down,<br />
Prompting the face grotesque, and antic brisk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">With many a lamb-like frisk,</span><br />
(He's got the scissors, snipping at your gown!)<br />

Balmy and breathing music like the South,<br />

Fresh as the morn, and brilliant as its star,&mdash;<br />
(I wish that window had an iron bar!)<br />
Bold as the hawk, yet gentle as the dove,&mdash;<br />

<h3>LITTLE MAMMA</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
Why is it the children don't love me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As they do Mamma?</span><br />
That they put her ever above me&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Little Mamma?"</span><br />
I'm sure I do all that I can do,<br />
What more can a rather big man do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Who can't be Mamma&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Little Mamma?</span><br />
<br />
Any game that the tyrants suggest,<br />
"Logomachy,"&mdash;which I detest,&mdash;<br />
Doll-babies, hop-scotch, or baseball,<br />
I'm always on hand at the call.<br />
When Noah and the others embark,<br />
I'm the elephant saved in the ark.<br />
I creep, and I climb, and I crawl&mdash;<br />
By turns am the animals all.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For the show on the stair</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I'm always the bear,</span><br />
Chimpanzee, camel, or kangaroo.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It is never, "Mamma,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Little</i> Mamma,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Won't <i>you</i>?"</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_944" id="Page_944">[Pg&nbsp;944]</a></span>

<br />
My umbrella's the pony, if any&mdash;<br />
None ride on Mamma's parasol:<br />
I'm supposed to have always the penny<br />
For bonbons, and beggars, and all.<br />
My room is the one where they clatter&mdash;<br />
Am I reading, or writing, what matter!<br />
My knee is the one for a trot,<br />
My foot is the stirrup for Dot.<br />
If his fractions get into a snarl<br />
Who straightens the tangles for Karl?<br />
Who bounds Massachusetts and Maine,<br />
And tries to bound flimsy old Spain?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Why,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It is <i>I</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Papa,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Not Little Mamma!</span><br />
<br />
That the youngsters are ingrates don't say.<br />
I think they love me&mdash;in a way&mdash;<br />
As one does the old clock on the stair,&mdash;<br />
Any curious, cumbrous affair<br />
That one's used to having about,<br />
And would feel rather lonely without.<br />
I think that they love me, I say,<br />
In a sort of a tolerant way;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But it's plain that Papa</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Isn't Little Mamma.</span><br />
<br />
Thus when twilight comes stealing anear,<br />
When things in the firelight look queer;<br />
And shadows the playroom enwrap,<br />
They never climb into my lap<br />
And toy with <i>my</i> head, smooth and bare,<br />
As they do with Mamma's shining hair;<br />
Nor feel round my throat and my chin<br />
For dimples to put fingers in;<br />
Nor lock my neck in a loving vise,<br />
And say they're "mousies"&mdash;that's mice&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And will nibble my ears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Will nibble and bite</span><br />
With their little mice-teeth, so sharp and so white,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_945" id="Page_945">[Pg&nbsp;945]</a></span>

If I do not kiss them this very minute&mdash;<br />
Don't-wait-a-bit-but-at-once-begin-it&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Dear little Papa!</span><br />
That's what they say and do to Mamma.<br />
<br />
If, mildly hinting, I quietly say that<br />
Kissing's a game that more can play at,<br />
They turn up at once those innocent eyes,<br />
And I suddenly learn to my great surprise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That my face has "prickles"&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">My moustache tickles.</span><br />
If, storming their camp, I seize a pert shaver,<br />
And take as a right what was asked as a favor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It is, "Oh, Papa,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">How horrid you are&mdash;</span><br />
You taste exactly like a cigar!"<br />
<br />
But though the rebels protest and pout,<br />
And make a pretence of driving me out,<br />
I hold, after all, the main redoubt,&mdash;<br />
Not by force of arms nor the force of will,<br />
But the power of love, which is mightier still.<br />
And very deep in their hearts, I know,<br />
Under the saucy and petulant "Oh,"<br />
The doubtful "Yes," or the naughty "No,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They love Papa.</span><br />
<br />
And down in the heart that no one sees,<br />
Where I hold my feasts and my jubilees,<br />
I know that I would not abate one jot<br />
Of the love that is held by my little Dot<br />
Or my great big boy for their little Mamma,<br />
Though out in the cold it crowded Papa.<br />
I would not abate it the tiniest whit,<br />
And I am not jealous the least little bit;<br />
For I'll tell you a secret: Come, my dears,<br />
And I'll whisper it&mdash;right-into-your-ears&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I, too, love Mamma,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Little Mamma!</span><br />

<h3>THE COMICAL GIRL</h3>
<table class='center' summary='poem'><tr><td>
<p>
There was a child, as I have been told,<br />
Who when she was young didn't look very old.<br />
Another thing, too, some people have said,<br />
At the top of her body there grew out a head;<br />
And what perhaps might make some people stare<br />
Her little bald pate was all covered with hair.<br />
Another strange thing which made gossipers talk,<br />
Was that she often attempted to walk.<br />
And then, do you know, she occasioned much fun<br />
By moving so fast as sometimes to run.<br />
Nay, indeed, I have heard that some people say<br />
She often would smile and often would play.<br />
And what is a fact, though it seems very odd,<br />
She had monstrous dislike to the feel of a rod.<br />
This strange little child sometimes hungry would be<br />
And then she delighted her victuals to see.<br />
Even drink she would swallow, and though strange it appears<br />
Whenever she listened it was with her ears.<br />
With her eyes she could see, and strange to relate<br />
Her peepers were placed in front of her pate.<br />
There, too, was her mouth and also her nose,<br />
And on her two feet were placed her ten toes.<br />
Her teeth, I've been told, were fixed in her gums,<br />
And beside having fingers she also had thumbs.<br />
A droll child she therefore most surely must be,<br />
For not being blind she was able to see.<br />
One circumstance more had slipped from my mind<br />
Which is when not cross she always was kind.<br />
And, strangest of any that yet I have said,<br />
She every night went to sleep on her bed.<br />
And, what may occasion you no small surprise,<br />
When napping, she always shut close up her eyes.<br />

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
